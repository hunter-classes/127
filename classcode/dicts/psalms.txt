Book 19        Psalms

19:001:001 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
           ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in
           the seat of the scornful.

19:001:002 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth
           he meditate day and night.

19:001:003 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
           that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also
           shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

19:001:004 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
           driveth away.

19:001:005 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor
           sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

19:001:006 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of
           the ungodly shall perish.

19:002:001 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

19:002:002 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
           counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed,
           saying,

19:002:003 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords
           from us.

19:002:004 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall
           have them in derision.

19:002:005 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in
           his sore displeasure.

19:002:006 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

19:002:007 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou
           art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

19:002:008 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
           inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
           possession.

19:002:009 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them
           in pieces like a potter's vessel.

19:002:010 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of
           the earth.

19:002:011 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

19:002:012 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
           when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they
           that put their trust in him.

19:003:001 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they
           that rise up against me.

19:003:002 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him
           in God. Selah.

19:003:003 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the
           lifter up of mine head.

19:003:004 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of
           his holy hill. Selah.

19:003:005 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

19:003:006 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
           themselves against me round about.

19:003:007 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all
           mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth
           of the ungodly.

19:003:008 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy
           people. Selah.

19:004:001 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast
           enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and
           hear my prayer.

19:004:002 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
           how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.

19:004:003 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for
           himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

19:004:004 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon
           your bed, and be still. Selah.

19:004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in
           the LORD.

19:004:006 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift
           thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.

19:004:007 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
           their corn and their wine increased.

19:004:008 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD,
           only makest me dwell in safety.

19:005:001 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

19:005:002 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for
           unto thee will I pray.

19:005:003 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the
           morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

19:005:004 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
           neither shall evil dwell with thee.

19:005:005 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all
           workers of iniquity.

19:005:006 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will
           abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

19:005:007 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of
           thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy
           temple.

19:005:008 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
           make thy way straight before my face.

19:005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part
           is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they
           flatter with their tongue.

19:005:010 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
           cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for
           they have rebelled against thee.

19:005:011 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let
           them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them
           also that love thy name be joyful in thee.

19:005:012 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt
           thou compass him as with a shield.

19:006:001 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in
           thy hot displeasure.

19:006:002 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me;
           for my bones are vexed.

19:006:003 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

19:006:004 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'
           sake.

19:006:005 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
           shall give thee thanks?

19:006:006 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to
           swim; I water my couch with my tears.

19:006:007 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because
           of all mine enemies.

19:006:008 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath
           heard the voice of my weeping.

19:006:009 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my
           prayer.

19:006:010 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them
           return and be ashamed suddenly.

19:007:001 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all
           them that persecute me, and deliver me:

19:007:002 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while
           there is none to deliver.

19:007:003 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my
           hands;

19:007:004 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
           (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

19:007:005 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him
           tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the
           dust. Selah.

19:007:006 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the
           rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that
           thou hast commanded.

19:007:007 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
           for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

19:007:008 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according
           to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is
           in me.

19:007:009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but
           establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts
           and reins.

19:007:010 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

19:007:011 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked
           every day.

19:007:012 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow,
           and made it ready.

19:007:013 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he
           ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

19:007:014 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived
           mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

19:007:015 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch
           which he made.

19:007:016 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent
           dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

19:007:017 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and
           will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

19:008:001 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
           who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

19:008:002 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
           strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still
           the enemy and the avenger.

19:008:003 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon
           and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

19:008:004 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,
           that thou visitest him?

19:008:005 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and
           hast crowned him with glory and honour.

19:008:006 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
           thou hast put all things under his feet:

19:008:007 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

19:008:008 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
           passeth through the paths of the seas.

19:008:009 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

19:009:001 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew
           forth all thy marvellous works.

19:009:002 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy
           name, O thou most High.

19:009:003 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish
           at thy presence.

19:009:004 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in
           the throne judging right.

19:009:005 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
           thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

19:009:006 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and
           thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with
           them.

19:009:007 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his
           throne for judgment.

19:009:008 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall
           minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

19:009:009 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
           times of trouble.

19:009:010 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for
           thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

19:009:011 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare
           among the people his doings.

19:009:012 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
           forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

19:009:013 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer
           of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates
           of death:

19:009:014 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the
           daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

19:009:015 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the
           net which they hid is their own foot taken.

19:009:016 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the
           wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion.
           Selah.

19:009:017 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that
           forget God.

19:009:018 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of
           the poor shall not perish for ever.

19:009:019 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged
           in thy sight.

19:009:020 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves
           to be but men. Selah.

19:010:001 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in
           times of trouble?

19:010:002 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
           taken in the devices that they have imagined.

19:010:003 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth
           the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.

19:010:004 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not
           seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.

19:010:005 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out
           of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

19:010:006 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall
           never be in adversity.

19:010:007 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
           tongue is mischief and vanity.

19:010:008 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the
           secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are
           privily set against the poor.

19:010:009 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in
           wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he
           draweth him into his net.

19:010:010 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by
           his strong ones.

19:010:011 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
           face; he will never see it.

19:010:012 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the
           humble.

19:010:013 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
           heart, Thou wilt not require it.

19:010:014 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
           requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto
           thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.

19:010:015 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out
           his wickedness till thou find none.

19:010:016 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished
           out of his land.

19:010:017 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt
           prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

19:010:018 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
           earth may no more oppress.

19:011:001 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a
           bird to your mountain?

19:011:002 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their
           arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the
           upright in heart.

19:011:003 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

19:011:004 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in
           heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

19:011:005 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that
           loveth violence his soul hateth.

19:011:006 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and
           an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.

19:011:007 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance
           doth behold the upright.

19:012:001 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail
           from among the children of men.

19:012:002 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with
           flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.

19:012:003 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue
           that speaketh proud things:

19:012:004 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are
           our own: who is lord over us?

19:012:005 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,
           now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety
           from him that puffeth at him.

19:012:006 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a
           furnace of earth, purified seven times.

19:012:007 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from
           this generation for ever.

19:012:008 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are
           exalted.

19:013:001 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt
           thou hide thy face from me?

19:013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
           heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

19:013:003 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I
           sleep the sleep of death;

19:013:004 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those
           that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

19:013:005 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
           salvation.

19:013:006 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully
           with me.

19:014:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
           corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that
           doeth good.

19:014:002 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to
           see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

19:014:003 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:
           there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

19:014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
           people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

19:014:005 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of
           the righteous.

19:014:006 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is
           his refuge.

19:014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when
           the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob
           shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

19:015:001 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in
           thy holy hill?

19:015:002 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
           speaketh the truth in his heart.

19:015:003 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
           neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

19:015:004 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth
           them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and
           changeth not.

19:015:005 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
           against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never
           be moved.

19:016:001 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

19:016:002 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
           goodness extendeth not to thee;

19:016:003 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent,
           in whom is all my delight.

19:016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another
           god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take
           up their names into my lips.

19:016:005 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
           thou maintainest my lot.

19:016:006 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a
           goodly heritage.

19:016:007 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins
           also instruct me in the night seasons.

19:016:008 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my
           right hand, I shall not be moved.

19:016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh
           also shall rest in hope.

19:016:010 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
           suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

19:016:011 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness
           of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

19:017:001 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
           prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.

19:017:002 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes
           behold the things that are equal.

19:017:003 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the
           night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am
           purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

19:017:004 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have
           kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

19:017:005 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

19:017:006 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline
           thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.

19:017:007 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
           right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that
           rise up against them.

19:017:008 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of
           thy wings,

19:017:009 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
           compass me about.

19:017:010 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they
           speak proudly.

19:017:011 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their
           eyes bowing down to the earth;

19:017:012 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
           young lion lurking in secret places.

19:017:013 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul
           from the wicked, which is thy sword:

19:017:014 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
           which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou
           fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and
           leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

19:017:015 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
           satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

19:018:001 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

19:018:002 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my
           God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the
           horn of my salvation, and my high tower.

19:018:003 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so
           shall I be saved from mine enemies.

19:018:004 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly
           men made me afraid.

19:018:005 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death
           prevented me.

19:018:006 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God:
           he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before
           him, even into his ears.

19:018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
           hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

19:018:008 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
           mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

19:018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was
           under his feet.

19:018:010 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon
           the wings of the wind.

19:018:011 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about
           him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

19:018:012 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
           hail stones and coals of fire.

19:018:013 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave
           his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

19:018:014 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot
           out lightnings, and discomfited them.

19:018:015 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of
           the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast
           of the breath of thy nostrils.

19:018:016 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

19:018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which
           hated me: for they were too strong for me.

19:018:018 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
           my stay.

19:018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
           because he delighted in me.

19:018:020 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according
           to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

19:018:021 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
           departed from my God.

19:018:022 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away
           his statutes from me.

19:018:023 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
           iniquity.

19:018:024 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
           righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his
           eyesight.

19:018:025 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
           upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

19:018:026 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
           froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.

19:018:027 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
           high looks.

19:018:028 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten
           my darkness.

19:018:029 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
           leaped over a wall.

19:018:030 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
           he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.

19:018:031 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?

19:018:032 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
           perfect.

19:018:033 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my
           high places.

19:018:034 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken
           by mine arms.

19:018:035 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
           right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me
           great.

19:018:036 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not
           slip.

19:018:037 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I
           turn again till they were consumed.

19:018:038 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
           fallen under my feet.

19:018:039 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou
           hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

19:018:040 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I
           might destroy them that hate me.

19:018:041 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the
           LORD, but he answered them not.

19:018:042 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did
           cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

19:018:043 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
           thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I
           have not known shall serve me.

19:018:044 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers
           shall submit themselves unto me.

19:018:045 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their
           close places.

19:018:046 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
           salvation be exalted.

19:018:047 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

19:018:048 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
           above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me
           from the violent man.

19:018:049 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
           heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

19:018:050 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
           his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

19:019:001 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
           sheweth his handywork.

19:019:002 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
           knowledge.

19:019:003 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not
           heard.

19:019:004 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words
           to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for
           the sun,

19:019:005 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and
           rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

19:019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit
           unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat
           thereof.

19:019:007 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
           testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

19:019:008 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
           commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

19:019:009 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the
           judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

19:019:010 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
           gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

19:019:011 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them
           there is great reward.

19:019:012 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
           faults.

19:019:013 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them
           not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I
           shall be innocent from the great transgression.

19:019:014 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
           acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.

19:020:001 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God
           of Jacob defend thee;

19:020:002 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
           Zion;

19:020:003 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
           Selah.

19:020:004 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
           counsel.

19:020:005 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God
           we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

19:020:006 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
           from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right
           hand.

19:020:007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will
           remember the name of the LORD our God.

19:020:008 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
           upright.

19:020:009 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

19:021:001 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy
           salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

19:021:002 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not
           withholden the request of his lips. Selah.

19:021:003 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
           settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

19:021:004 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
           days for ever and ever.

19:021:005 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast
           thou laid upon him.

19:021:006 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made
           him exceeding glad with thy countenance.

19:021:007 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of
           the most High he shall not be moved.

19:021:008 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand
           shall find out those that hate thee.

19:021:009 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine
           anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the
           fire shall devour them.

19:021:010 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed
           from among the children of men.

19:021:011 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a
           mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.

19:021:012 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou
           shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the
           face of them.

19:021:013 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing
           and praise thy power.

19:022:001 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
           from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

19:022:002 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in
           the night season, and am not silent.

19:022:003 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of
           Israel.

19:022:004 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst
           deliver them.

19:022:005 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in
           thee, and were not confounded.

19:022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised
           of the people.

19:022:007 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the
           lip, they shake the head, saying,

19:022:008 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him
           deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

19:022:009 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make
           me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.

19:022:010 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
           mother's belly.

19:022:011 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to
           help.

19:022:012 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have
           beset me round.

19:022:013 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
           roaring lion.

19:022:014 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:
           my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

19:022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue
           cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of
           death.

19:022:016 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
           inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

19:022:017 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

19:022:018 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
           vesture.

19:022:019 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee
           to help me.

19:022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of
           the dog.

19:022:021 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
           horns of the unicorns.

19:022:022 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
           congregation will I praise thee.

19:022:023 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
           glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

19:022:024 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
           afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he
           cried unto him, he heard.

19:022:025 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will
           pay my vows before them that fear him.

19:022:026 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the
           LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

19:022:027 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the
           LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before
           thee.

19:022:028 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among
           the nations.

19:022:029 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all
           they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none
           can keep alive his own soul.

19:022:030 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for
           a generation.

19:022:031 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
           people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

19:023:001 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

19:023:002 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me
           beside the still waters.

19:023:003 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of
           righteousness for his name's sake.

19:023:004 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
           I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
           staff they comfort me.

19:023:005 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
           enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

19:023:006 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
           life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

19:024:001 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world,
           and they that dwell therein.

19:024:002 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon
           the floods.

19:024:003 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand
           in his holy place?

19:024:004 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not
           lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

19:024:005 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness
           from the God of his salvation.

19:024:006 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy
           face, O Jacob. Selah.

19:024:007 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye
           everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

19:024:008 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the
           LORD mighty in battle.

19:024:009 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye
           everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

19:024:010 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King
           of glory. Selah.

19:025:001 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

19:025:002 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
           enemies triumph over me.

19:025:003 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be
           ashamed which transgress without cause.

19:025:004 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

19:025:005 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
           salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

19:025:006 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
           for they have been ever of old.

19:025:007 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
           according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness'
           sake, O LORD.

19:025:008 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners
           in the way.

19:025:009 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
           his way.

19:025:010 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as
           keep his covenant and his testimonies.

19:025:011 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
           great.

19:025:012 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in
           the way that he shall choose.

19:025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
           earth.

19:025:014 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will
           shew them his covenant.

19:025:015 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet
           out of the net.

19:025:016 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate
           and afflicted.

19:025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of
           my distresses.

19:025:018 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my
           sins.

19:025:019 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me
           with cruel hatred.

19:025:020 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I
           put my trust in thee.

19:025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

19:025:022 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

19:026:001 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have
           trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

19:026:002 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

19:026:003 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked
           in thy truth.

19:026:004 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
           dissemblers.

19:026:005 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit
           with the wicked.

19:026:006 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
           altar, O LORD:

19:026:007 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
           all thy wondrous works.

19:026:008 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
           where thine honour dwelleth.

19:026:009 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

19:026:010 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
           bribes.

19:026:011 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and
           be merciful unto me.

19:026:012 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I
           bless the LORD.

19:027:001 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
           LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

19:027:002 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
           to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

19:027:003 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not
           fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be
           confident.

19:027:004 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
           that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my
           life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his
           temple.

19:027:005 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
           in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set
           me up upon a rock.

19:027:006 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
           about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices
           of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

19:027:007 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon
           me, and answer me.

19:027:008 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee,
           Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

19:027:009 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in
           anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake
           me, O God of my salvation.

19:027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will
           take me up.

19:027:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because
           of mine enemies.

19:027:012 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
           witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out
           cruelty.

19:027:013 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of
           the LORD in the land of the living.

19:027:014 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
           thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

19:028:001 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me:
           lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down
           into the pit.

19:028:002 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when
           I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

19:028:003 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
           iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief
           is in their hearts.

19:028:004 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
           wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of
           their hands; render to them their desert.

19:028:005 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the
           operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build
           them up.

19:028:006 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
           supplications.

19:028:007 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in
           him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
           and with my song will I praise him.

19:028:008 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of
           his anointed.

19:028:009 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also,
           and lift them up for ever.

19:029:001 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
           strength.

19:029:002 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the
           LORD in the beauty of holiness.

19:029:003 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
           thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.

19:029:004 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is
           full of majesty.

19:029:005 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD
           breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.

19:029:006 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion
           like a young unicorn.

19:029:007 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.

19:029:008 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
           the wilderness of Kadesh.

19:029:009 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and
           discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one
           speak of his glory.

19:029:010 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King
           for ever.

19:029:011 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will
           bless his people with peace.

19:030:001 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and
           hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

19:030:002 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

19:030:003 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast
           kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

19:030:004 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
           remembrance of his holiness.

19:030:005 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
           weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

19:030:006 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

19:030:007 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand
           strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

19:030:008 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made
           supplication.

19:030:009 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
           Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

19:030:010 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

19:030:011 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast
           put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

19:030:012 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
           silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

19:031:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
           deliver me in thy righteousness.

19:031:002 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my
           strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.

19:031:003 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's
           sake lead me, and guide me.

19:031:004 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
           thou art my strength.

19:031:005 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O
           LORD God of truth.

19:031:006 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in
           the LORD.

19:031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast
           considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

19:031:008 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast
           set my feet in a large room.

19:031:009 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
           consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

19:031:010 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
           strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are
           consumed.

19:031:011 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among
           my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did
           see me without fled from me.

19:031:012 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
           vessel.

19:031:013 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:
           while they took counsel together against me, they devised to
           take away my life.

19:031:014 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.

19:031:015 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
           enemies, and from them that persecute me.

19:031:016 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
           mercies' sake.

19:031:017 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee:
           let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the
           grave.

19:031:018 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
           things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

19:031:019 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
           that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in
           thee before the sons of men!

19:031:020 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
           pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from
           the strife of tongues.

19:031:021 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
           kindness in a strong city.

19:031:022 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
           nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when
           I cried unto thee.

19:031:023 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth
           the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

19:031:024 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
           that hope in the LORD.

19:032:001 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
           covered.

19:032:002 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity,
           and in whose spirit there is no guile.

19:032:003 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
           the day long.

19:032:004 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
           turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

19:032:005 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
           hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD;
           and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

19:032:006 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a
           time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great
           waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

19:032:007 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
           thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

19:032:008 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
           shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.

19:032:009 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
           understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and
           bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

19:032:010 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in
           the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

19:032:011 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for
           joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

19:033:001 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for
           the upright.

19:033:002 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and
           an instrument of ten strings.

19:033:003 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

19:033:004 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done
           in truth.

19:033:005 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
           goodness of the LORD.

19:033:006 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the
           host of them by the breath of his mouth.

19:033:007 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he
           layeth up the depth in storehouses.

19:033:008 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of
           the world stand in awe of him.

19:033:009 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood
           fast.

19:033:010 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
           maketh the devices of the people of none effect.

19:033:011 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
           heart to all generations.

19:033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people
           whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

19:033:013 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of
           men.

19:033:014 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
           inhabitants of the earth.

19:033:015 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
           works.

19:033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty
           man is not delivered by much strength.

19:033:017 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
           any by his great strength.

19:033:018 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
           them that hope in his mercy;

19:033:019 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
           famine.

19:033:020 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.

19:033:021 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
           his holy name.

19:033:022 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in
           thee.

19:034:001 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall
           continually be in my mouth.

19:034:002 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall
           hear thereof, and be glad.

19:034:003 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name
           together.

19:034:004 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all
           my fears.

19:034:005 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
           not ashamed.

19:034:006 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out
           of all his troubles.

19:034:007 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear
           him, and delivereth them.

19:034:008 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
           trusteth in him.

19:034:009 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them
           that fear him.

19:034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek
           the LORD shall not want any good thing.

19:034:011 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear
           of the LORD.

19:034:012 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that
           he may see good?

19:034:013 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

19:034:014 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

19:034:015 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are
           open unto their cry.

19:034:016 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off
           the remembrance of them from the earth.

19:034:017 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them
           out of all their troubles.

19:034:018 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
           saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

19:034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD
           delivereth him out of them all.

19:034:020 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

19:034:021 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous
           shall be desolate.

19:034:022 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them
           that trust in him shall be desolate.

19:035:001 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
           against them that fight against me.

19:035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

19:035:003 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
           persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

19:035:004 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my
           soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that
           devise my hurt.

19:035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
           LORD chase them.

19:035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the
           LORD persecute them.

19:035:007 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,
           which without cause they have digged for my soul.

19:035:008 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net
           that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let
           him fall.

19:035:009 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in
           his salvation.

19:035:010 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
           deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea,
           the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?

19:035:011 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things
           that I knew not.

19:035:012 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

19:035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth:
           I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into
           mine own bosom.

19:035:014 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I
           bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.

19:035:015 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
           together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together
           against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased
           not:

19:035:016 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
           their teeth.

19:035:017 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
           destructions, my darling from the lions.

19:035:018 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will
           praise thee among much people.

19:035:019 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
           neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a
           cause.

19:035:020 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
           against them that are quiet in the land.

19:035:021 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
           aha, our eye hath seen it.

19:035:022 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not
           far from me.

19:035:023 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
           my God and my Lord.

19:035:024 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and
           let them not rejoice over me.

19:035:025 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let
           them not say, We have swallowed him up.

19:035:026 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
           rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and
           dishonour that magnify themselves against me.

19:035:027 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous
           cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be
           magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
           servant.

19:035:028 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy
           praise all the day long.

19:036:001 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that
           there is no fear of God before his eyes.

19:036:002 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity
           be found to be hateful.

19:036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left
           off to be wise, and to do good.

19:036:004 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
           that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

19:036:005 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
           reacheth unto the clouds.

19:036:006 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments
           are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

19:036:007 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
           children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

19:036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy
           house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy
           pleasures.

19:036:009 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we
           see light.

19:036:010 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and
           thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

19:036:011 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the
           hand of the wicked remove me.

19:036:012 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,
           and shall not be able to rise.

19:037:001 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
           against the workers of iniquity.

19:037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as
           the green herb.

19:037:003 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the
           land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

19:037:004 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
           desires of thine heart.

19:037:005 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
           bring it to pass.

19:037:006 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and
           thy judgment as the noonday.

19:037:007 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
           because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man
           who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

19:037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any
           wise to do evil.

19:037:009 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
           LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

19:037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
           shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

19:037:011 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
           themselves in the abundance of peace.

19:037:012 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him
           with his teeth.

19:037:013 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
           coming.

19:037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
           to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of
           upright conversation.

19:037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
           shall be broken.

19:037:016 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches
           of many wicked.

19:037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
           upholdeth the righteous.

19:037:018 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their
           inheritance shall be for ever.

19:037:019 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
           famine they shall be satisfied.

19:037:020 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
           be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall
           they consume away.

19:037:021 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
           sheweth mercy, and giveth.

19:037:022 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and
           they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.

19:037:023 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
           delighteth in his way.

19:037:024 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the
           LORD upholdeth him with his hand.

19:037:025 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
           righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

19:037:026 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

19:037:027 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

19:037:028 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints;
           they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall
           be cut off.

19:037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
           ever.

19:037:030 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
           talketh of judgment.

19:037:031 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
           slide.

19:037:032 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

19:037:033 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when
           he is judged.

19:037:034 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
           inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see
           it.

19:037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
           like a green bay tree.

19:037:036 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him,
           but he could not be found.

19:037:037 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
           that man is peace.

19:037:038 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
           the wicked shall be cut off.

19:037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
           strength in the time of trouble.

19:037:040 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall
           deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they
           trust in him.

19:038:001 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy
           hot displeasure.

19:038:002 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me
           sore.

19:038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
           neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

19:038:004 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy
           burden they are too heavy for me.

19:038:005 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

19:038:006 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the
           day long.

19:038:007 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is
           no soundness in my flesh.

19:038:008 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
           disquietness of my heart.

19:038:009 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid
           from thee.

19:038:010 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of
           mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

19:038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
           kinsmen stand afar off.

19:038:012 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
           that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine
           deceits all the day long.

19:038:013 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
           openeth not his mouth.

19:038:014 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are
           no reproofs.

19:038:015 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

19:038:016 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over
           me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

19:038:017 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before
           me.

19:038:018 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

19:038:019 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they
           that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

19:038:020 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
           because I follow the thing that good is.

19:038:021 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

19:038:022 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.

19:039:001 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
           tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked
           is before me.

19:039:002 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and
           my sorrow was stirred.

19:039:003 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire
           burned: then spake I with my tongue,

19:039:004 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,
           what it is: that I may know how frail I am.

19:039:005 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age
           is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state
           is altogether vanity. Selah.

19:039:006 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
           disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who
           shall gather them.

19:039:007 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.

19:039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the
           reproach of the foolish.

19:039:009 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.

19:039:010 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
           thine hand.

19:039:011 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
           makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every
           man is vanity. Selah.

19:039:012 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
           peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a
           sojourner, as all my fathers were.

19:039:013 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence,
           and be no more.

19:040:001 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
           heard my cry.

19:040:002 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
           clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

19:040:003 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our
           God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

19:040:004 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
           respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

19:040:005 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
           done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be
           reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak
           of them, they are more than can be numbered.

19:040:006 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast
           thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not
           required.

19:040:007 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
           written of me,

19:040:008 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
           heart.

19:040:009 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I
           have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

19:040:010 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
           declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not
           concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great
           congregation.

19:040:011 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
           lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

19:040:012 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities
           have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
           they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart
           faileth me.

19:040:013 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help
           me.

19:040:014 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
           soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to
           shame that wish me evil.

19:040:015 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
           me, Aha, aha.

19:040:016 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
           such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be
           magnified.

19:040:017 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou
           art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

19:041:001 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver
           him in time of trouble.

19:041:002 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall
           be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto
           the will of his enemies.

19:041:003 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
           wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

19:041:004 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
           sinned against thee.

19:041:005 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
           perish?

19:041:006 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart
           gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth
           it.

19:041:007 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do
           they devise my hurt.

19:041:008 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now
           that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

19:041:009 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did
           eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

19:041:010 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
           may requite them.

19:041:011 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
           not triumph over me.

19:041:012 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and
           settest me before thy face for ever.

19:041:013 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
           everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

19:042:001 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
           after thee, O God.

19:042:002 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I
           come and appear before God?

19:042:003 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they
           continually say unto me, Where is thy God?

19:042:004 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I
           had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of
           God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that
           kept holyday.

19:042:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
           in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the
           help of his countenance.

19:042:006 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I
           remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites,
           from the hill Mizar.

19:042:007 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all
           thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

19:042:008 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time,
           and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto
           the God of my life.

19:042:009 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why
           go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

19:042:010 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
           they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?

19:042:011 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
           within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who
           is the health of my countenance, and my God.

19:043:001 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:
           O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

19:043:002 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me
           off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

19:043:003 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them
           bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

19:043:004 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding
           joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

19:043:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
           within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the
           health of my countenance, and my God.

19:044:001 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
           what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

19:044:002 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and
           plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast
           them out.

19:044:003 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
           neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and
           thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou
           hadst a favour unto them.

19:044:004 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

19:044:005 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name
           will we tread them under that rise up against us.

19:044:006 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save
           me.

19:044:007 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
           shame that hated us.

19:044:008 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for
           ever. Selah.

19:044:009 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not
           forth with our armies.

19:044:010 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which
           hate us spoil for themselves.

19:044:011 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
           scattered us among the heathen.

19:044:012 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
           wealth by their price.

19:044:013 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
           derision to them that are round about us.

19:044:014 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the
           head among the people.

19:044:015 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my
           face hath covered me,

19:044:016 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by
           reason of the enemy and avenger.

19:044:017 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
           neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

19:044:018 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
           from thy way;

19:044:019 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
           covered us with the shadow of death.

19:044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
           hands to a strange god;

19:044:021 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of
           the heart.

19:044:022 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are
           counted as sheep for the slaughter.

19:044:023 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
           ever.

19:044:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
           and our oppression?

19:044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth
           unto the earth.

19:044:026 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.

19:045:001 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things
           which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a
           ready writer.

19:045:002 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into
           thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

19:045:003 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory
           and thy majesty.

19:045:004 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
           meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach
           thee terrible things.

19:045:005 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
           whereby the people fall under thee.

19:045:006 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
           kingdom is a right sceptre.

19:045:007 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore
           God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
           above thy fellows.

19:045:008 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
           the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

19:045:009 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy
           right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

19:045:010 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
           forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;

19:045:011 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy
           Lord; and worship thou him.

19:045:012 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the
           rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.

19:045:013 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
           wrought gold.

19:045:014 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework:
           the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought
           unto thee.

19:045:015 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall
           enter into the king's palace.

19:045:016 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest
           make princes in all the earth.

19:045:017 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
           therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

19:046:001 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
           trouble.

19:046:002 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
           though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

19:046:003 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
           mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

19:046:004 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city
           of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

19:046:005 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall
           help her, and that right early.

19:046:006 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his
           voice, the earth melted.

19:046:007 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
           Selah.

19:046:008 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath
           made in the earth.

19:046:009 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
           the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the
           chariot in the fire.

19:046:010 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
           heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

19:046:011 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
           Selah.

19:047:001 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the
           voice of triumph.

19:047:002 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over
           all the earth.

19:047:003 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
           feet.

19:047:004 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of
           Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

19:047:005 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
           trumpet.

19:047:006 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
           sing praises.

19:047:007 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
           understanding.

19:047:008 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of
           his holiness.

19:047:009 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the
           people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth
           belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.

19:048:001 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of
           our God, in the mountain of his holiness.

19:048:002 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount
           Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

19:048:003 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

19:048:004 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

19:048:005 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
           hasted away.

19:048:006 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
           travail.

19:048:007 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

19:048:008 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
           hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
           Selah.

19:048:009 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of
           thy temple.

19:048:010 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends
           of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

19:048:011 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
           because of thy judgments.

19:048:012 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
           thereof.

19:048:013 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
           tell it to the generation following.

19:048:014 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our
           guide even unto death.

19:049:001 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
           world:

19:049:002 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

19:049:003 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
           shall be of understanding.

19:049:004 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark
           saying upon the harp.

19:049:005 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity
           of my heels shall compass me about?

19:049:006 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
           multitude of their riches;

19:049:007 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to
           God a ransom for him:

19:049:008 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth
           for ever:)

19:049:009 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

19:049:010 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
           brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

19:049:011 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
           ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call
           their lands after their own names.

19:049:012 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
           beasts that perish.

19:049:013 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve
           their sayings. Selah.

19:049:014 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on
           them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the
           morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from
           their dwelling.

19:049:015 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for
           he shall receive me. Selah.

19:049:016 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of
           his house is increased;

19:049:017 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall
           not descend after him.

19:049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise
           thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

19:049:019 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
           see light.

19:049:020 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the
           beasts that perish.

19:050:001 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the
           earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

19:050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

19:050:003 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
           devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
           about him.

19:050:004 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth,
           that he may judge his people.

19:050:005 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
           covenant with me by sacrifice.

19:050:006 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is
           judge himself. Selah.

19:050:007 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will
           testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.

19:050:008 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
           offerings, to have been continually before me.

19:050:009 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of
           thy folds.

19:050:010 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
           thousand hills.

19:050:011 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of
           the field are mine.

19:050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is
           mine, and the fulness thereof.

19:050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

19:050:014 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
           High:

19:050:015 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,
           and thou shalt glorify me.

19:050:016 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
           my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
           mouth?

19:050:017 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind
           thee.

19:050:018 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
           hast been partaker with adulterers.

19:050:019 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

19:050:020 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
           thine own mother's son.

19:050:021 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou
           thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I
           will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

19:050:022 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
           pieces, and there be none to deliver.

19:050:023 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
           his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

19:051:001 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
           according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
           transgressions.

19:051:002 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
           sin.

19:051:003 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
           me.

19:051:004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in
           thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
           and be clear when thou judgest.

19:051:005 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
           conceive me.

19:051:006 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
           hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

19:051:007 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
           shall be whiter than snow.

19:051:008 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou
           hast broken may rejoice.

19:051:009 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

19:051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
           within me.

19:051:011 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy
           spirit from me.

19:051:012 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with
           thy free spirit.

19:051:013 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
           converted unto thee.

19:051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
           salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
           righteousness.

19:051:015 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
           praise.

19:051:016 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
           delightest not in burnt offering.

19:051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
           contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

19:051:018 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls
           of Jerusalem.

19:051:019 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of
           righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
           then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

19:052:001 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the
           goodness of God endureth continually.

19:052:002 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
           deceitfully.

19:052:003 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to
           speak righteousness. Selah.

19:052:004 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

19:052:005 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
           away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee
           out of the land of the living. Selah.

19:052:006 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at
           him:

19:052:007 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but
           trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
           himself in his wickedness.

19:052:008 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust
           in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

19:052:009 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
           will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.

19:053:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
           they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that
           doeth good.

19:053:002 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
           if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.

19:053:003 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
           filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

19:053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
           people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

19:053:005 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
           scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou
           hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.

19:053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When
           God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall
           rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

19:054:001 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

19:054:002 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

19:054:003 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek
           after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

19:054:004 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold
           my soul.

19:054:005 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
           truth.

19:054:006 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
           LORD; for it is good.

19:054:007 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
           seen his desire upon mine enemies.

19:055:001 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
           supplication.

19:055:002 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make
           a noise;

19:055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression
           of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath
           they hate me.

19:055:004 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death
           are fallen upon me.

19:055:005 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
           overwhelmed me.

19:055:006 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I
           fly away, and be at rest.

19:055:007 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
           Selah.

19:055:008 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

19:055:009 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
           violence and strife in the city.

19:055:010 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
           mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

19:055:011 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart
           not from her streets.

19:055:012 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
           borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify
           himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

19:055:013 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
           acquaintance.

19:055:014 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of
           God in company.

19:055:015 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into
           hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

19:055:016 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

19:055:017 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
           and he shall hear my voice.

19:055:018 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
           against me: for there were many with me.

19:055:019 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
           Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not
           God.

19:055:020 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
           him: he hath broken his covenant.

19:055:021 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was
           in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they
           drawn swords.

19:055:022 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
           shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

19:055:023 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
           destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half
           their days; but I will trust in thee.

19:056:001 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
           fighting daily oppresseth me.

19:056:002 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that
           fight against me, O thou most High.

19:056:003 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

19:056:004 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I
           will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

19:056:005 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against
           me for evil.

19:056:006 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they
           mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

19:056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
           people, O God.

19:056:008 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
           are they not in thy book?

19:056:009 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this
           I know; for God is for me.

19:056:010 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
           word.

19:056:011 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can
           do unto me.

19:056:012 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

19:056:013 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
           deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in
           the light of the living?

19:057:001 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
           trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make
           my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.

19:057:002 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
           things for me.

19:057:003 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of
           him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his
           mercy and his truth.

19:057:004 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set
           on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
           arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

19:057:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be
           above all the earth.

19:057:006 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
           they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they
           are fallen themselves. Selah.

19:057:007 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and
           give praise.

19:057:008 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will
           awake early.

19:057:009 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
           thee among the nations.

19:057:010 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto
           the clouds.

19:057:011 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
           above all the earth.

19:058:001 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
           uprightly, O ye sons of men?

19:058:002 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of
           your hands in the earth.

19:058:003 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon
           as they be born, speaking lies.

19:058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like
           the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

19:058:005 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming
           never so wisely.

19:058:006 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great
           teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

19:058:007 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
           bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in
           pieces.

19:058:008 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away:
           like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the
           sun.

19:058:009 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away
           as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

19:058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
           shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

19:058:011 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
           righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

19:059:001 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them
           that rise up against me.

19:059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from
           bloody men.

19:059:003 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered
           against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

19:059:004 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to
           help me, and behold.

19:059:005 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake
           to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked
           transgressors. Selah.

19:059:006 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
           round about the city.

19:059:007 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their
           lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

19:059:008 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
           heathen in derision.

19:059:009 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
           defence.

19:059:010 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my
           desire upon mine enemies.

19:059:011 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy
           power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

19:059:012 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let
           them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying
           which they speak.

19:059:013 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and
           let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the
           earth. Selah.

19:059:014 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like
           a dog, and go round about the city.

19:059:015 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be
           not satisfied.

19:059:016 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
           mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge
           in the day of my trouble.

19:059:017 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
           and the God of my mercy.

19:060:001 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou
           hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

19:060:002 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal
           the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

19:060:003 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to
           drink the wine of astonishment.

19:060:004 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may
           be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

19:060:005 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand,
           and hear me.

19:060:006 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
           Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

19:060:007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
           strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

19:060:008 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe:
           Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

19:060:009 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
           Edom?

19:060:010 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O
           God, which didst not go out with our armies?

19:060:011 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

19:060:012 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
           tread down our enemies.

19:061:001 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

19:061:002 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart
           is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

19:061:003 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from
           the enemy.

19:061:004 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the
           covert of thy wings. Selah.

19:061:005 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the
           heritage of those that fear thy name.

19:061:006 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many
           generations.

19:061:007 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,
           which may preserve him.

19:061:008 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
           perform my vows.

19:062:001 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.

19:062:002 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall
           not be greatly moved.

19:062:003 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
           slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a
           tottering fence.

19:062:004 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
           delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse
           inwardly. Selah.

19:062:005 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from
           him.

19:062:006 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall
           not be moved.

19:062:007 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,
           and my refuge, is in God.

19:062:008 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart
           before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

19:062:009 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree
           are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether
           lighter than vanity.

19:062:010 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
           riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

19:062:011 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
           belongeth unto God.

19:062:012 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to
           every man according to his work.

19:063:001 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
           thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
           thirsty land, where no water is;

19:063:002 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
           sanctuary.

19:063:003 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
           praise thee.

19:063:004 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands
           in thy name.

19:063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
           mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:

19:063:006 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
           night watches.

19:063:007 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy
           wings will I rejoice.

19:063:008 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth
           me.

19:063:009 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
           lower parts of the earth.

19:063:010 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for
           foxes.

19:063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by
           him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall
           be stopped.

19:064:001 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear
           of the enemy.

19:064:002 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
           insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

19:064:003 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to
           shoot their arrows, even bitter words:

19:064:004 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they
           shoot at him, and fear not.

19:064:005 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of
           laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

19:064:006 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
           both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart,
           is deep.

19:064:007 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they
           be wounded.

19:064:008 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
           all that see them shall flee away.

19:064:009 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
           they shall wisely consider of his doing.

19:064:010 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in
           him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

19:065:001 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall
           the vow be performed.

19:065:002 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

19:065:003 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou
           shalt purge them away.

19:065:004 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
           unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be
           satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy
           temple.

19:065:005 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God
           of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of
           the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

19:065:006 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
           with power:

19:065:007 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their
           waves, and the tumult of the people.

19:065:008 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
           tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening
           to rejoice.

19:065:009 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly
           enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water:
           thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

19:065:010 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
           furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou
           blessest the springing thereof.

19:065:011 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
           fatness.

19:065:012 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little
           hills rejoice on every side.

19:065:013 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
           covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

19:066:001 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

19:066:002 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

19:066:003 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
           greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves
           unto thee.

19:066:004 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee;
           they shall sing to thy name. Selah.

19:066:005 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing
           toward the children of men.

19:066:006 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood
           on foot: there did we rejoice in him.

19:066:007 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:
           let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

19:066:008 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise
           to be heard:

19:066:009 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to
           be moved.

19:066:010 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver
           is tried.

19:066:011 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon
           our loins.

19:066:012 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
           fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a
           wealthy place.

19:066:013 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee
           my vows,

19:066:014 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I
           was in trouble.

19:066:015 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
           incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

19:066:016 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what
           he hath done for my soul.

19:066:017 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
           tongue.

19:066:018 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

19:066:019 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of
           my prayer.

19:066:020 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
           mercy from me.

19:067:001 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
           shine upon us; Selah.

19:067:002 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among
           all nations.

19:067:003 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
           thee.

19:067:004 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt
           judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon
           earth. Selah.

19:067:005 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
           thee.

19:067:006 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own
           God, shall bless us.

19:067:007 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear
           him.

19:068:001 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also
           that hate him flee before him.

19:068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
           before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of
           God.

19:068:003 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God:
           yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

19:068:004 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth
           upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

19:068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God
           in his holy habitation.

19:068:006 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those
           which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry
           land.

19:068:007 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou
           didst march through the wilderness; Selah:

19:068:008 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of
           God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the
           God of Israel.

19:068:009 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
           confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.

19:068:010 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast
           prepared of thy goodness for the poor.

19:068:011 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that
           published it.

19:068:012 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
           divided the spoil.

19:068:013 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the
           wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with
           yellow gold.

19:068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow
           in Salmon.

19:068:015 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
           hill of Bashan.

19:068:016 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God
           desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.

19:068:017 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
           angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy
           place.

19:068:018 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
           thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious
           also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.

19:068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
           the God of our salvation. Selah.

19:068:020 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
           Lord belong the issues from death.

19:068:021 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy
           scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

19:068:022 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
           people again from the depths of the sea:

19:068:023 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and
           the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

19:068:024 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God,
           my King, in the sanctuary.

19:068:025 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
           after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.

19:068:026 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
           fountain of Israel.

19:068:027 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of
           Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the
           princes of Naphtali.

19:068:028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that
           which thou hast wrought for us.

19:068:029 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
           unto thee.

19:068:030 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls,
           with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself
           with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in
           war.

19:068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch
           out her hands unto God.

19:068:032 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto
           the Lord; Selah:

19:068:033 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of
           old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

19:068:034 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel,
           and his strength is in the clouds.

19:068:035 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of
           Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.
           Blessed be God.

19:069:001 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.

19:069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come
           into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

19:069:003 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail
           while I wait for my God.

19:069:004 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
           mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies
           wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not
           away.

19:069:005 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid
           from thee.

19:069:006 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be
           ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be
           confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

19:069:007 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered
           my face.

19:069:008 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
           mother's children.

19:069:009 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the
           reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

19:069:010 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to
           my reproach.

19:069:011 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
           them.

19:069:012 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
           of the drunkards.

19:069:013 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an
           acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me,
           in the truth of thy salvation.

19:069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be
           delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

19:069:015 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep
           swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

19:069:016 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
           according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

19:069:017 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
           hear me speedily.

19:069:018 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
           mine enemies.

19:069:019 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
           mine adversaries are all before thee.

19:069:020 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and
           I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for
           comforters, but I found none.

19:069:021 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
           me vinegar to drink.

19:069:022 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
           should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

19:069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
           loins continually to shake.

19:069:024 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful
           anger take hold of them.

19:069:025 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
           tents.

19:069:026 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk
           to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

19:069:027 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into
           thy righteousness.

19:069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
           written with the righteous.

19:069:029 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me
           up on high.

19:069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify
           him with thanksgiving.

19:069:031 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
           that hath horns and hoofs.

19:069:032 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall
           live that seek God.

19:069:033 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his
           prisoners.

19:069:034 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
           that moveth therein.

19:069:035 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah:
           that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

19:069:036 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that
           love his name shall dwell therein.

19:070:001 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O
           LORD.

19:070:002 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul:
           let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire
           my hurt.

19:070:003 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
           Aha, aha.

19:070:004 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and
           let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be
           magnified.

19:070:005 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art
           my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

19:071:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
           confusion.

19:071:002 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape:
           incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

19:071:003 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually
           resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art
           my rock and my fortress.

19:071:004 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of
           the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

19:071:005 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
           youth.

19:071:006 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
           took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be
           continually of thee.

19:071:007 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.

19:071:008 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
           the day.

19:071:009 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
           strength faileth.

19:071:010 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for
           my soul take counsel together,

19:071:011 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for
           there is none to deliver him.

19:071:012 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

19:071:013 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
           soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that
           seek my hurt.

19:071:014 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
           more.

19:071:015 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
           all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.

19:071:016 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
           of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

19:071:017 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
           declared thy wondrous works.

19:071:018 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
           until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy
           power to every one that is to come.

19:071:019 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done
           great things: O God, who is like unto thee!

19:071:020 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
           quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths
           of the earth.

19:071:021 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every
           side.

19:071:022 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O
           my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One
           of Israel.

19:071:023 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
           soul, which thou hast redeemed.

19:071:024 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day
           long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto
           shame, that seek my hurt.

19:072:001 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
           the king's son.

19:072:002 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor
           with judgment.

19:072:003 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
           hills, by righteousness.

19:072:004 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the
           children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the
           oppressor.

19:072:005 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
           throughout all generations.

19:072:006 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers
           that water the earth.

19:072:007 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of
           peace so long as the moon endureth.

19:072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the
           river unto the ends of the earth.

19:072:009 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and
           his enemies shall lick the dust.

19:072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
           the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

19:072:011 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
           serve him.

19:072:012 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
           and him that hath no helper.

19:072:013 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
           the needy.

19:072:014 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
           precious shall their blood be in his sight.

19:072:015 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
           Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and
           daily shall he be praised.

19:072:016 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
           the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and
           they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

19:072:017 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as
           long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations
           shall call him blessed.

19:072:018 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
           wondrous things.

19:072:019 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
           earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

19:072:020 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

19:073:001 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
           heart.

19:073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well
           nigh slipped.

19:073:003 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
           the wicked.

19:073:004 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
           firm.

19:073:005 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
           like other men.

19:073:006 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
           covereth them as a garment.

19:073:007 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
           could wish.

19:073:008 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
           they speak loftily.

19:073:009 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
           walketh through the earth.

19:073:010 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup
           are wrung out to them.

19:073:011 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
           most High?

19:073:012 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
           increase in riches.

19:073:013 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands
           in innocency.

19:073:014 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
           morning.

19:073:015 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against
           the generation of thy children.

19:073:016 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

19:073:017 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I
           their end.

19:073:018 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
           them down into destruction.

19:073:019 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
           utterly consumed with terrors.

19:073:020 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest,
           thou shalt despise their image.

19:073:021 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

19:073:022 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.

19:073:023 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me
           by my right hand.

19:073:024 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
           to glory.

19:073:025 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
           that I desire beside thee.

19:073:026 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
           heart, and my portion for ever.

19:073:027 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
           destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

19:073:028 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
           in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

19:074:001 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine
           anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

19:074:002 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old;
           the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this
           mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

19:074:003 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
           the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

19:074:004 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set
           up their ensigns for signs.

19:074:005 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
           thick trees.

19:074:006 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with
           axes and hammers.

19:074:007 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
           casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

19:074:008 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
           have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

19:074:009 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is
           there among us any that knoweth how long.

19:074:010 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
           blaspheme thy name for ever?

19:074:011 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it
           out of thy bosom.

19:074:012 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of
           the earth.

19:074:013 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
           heads of the dragons in the waters.

19:074:014 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him
           to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

19:074:015 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
           mighty rivers.

19:074:016 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared
           the light and the sun.

19:074:017 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
           summer and winter.

19:074:018 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and
           that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

19:074:019 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
           the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

19:074:020 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the
           earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

19:074:021 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
           praise thy name.

19:074:022 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
           man reproacheth thee daily.

19:074:023 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those
           that rise up against thee increaseth continually.

19:075:001 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give
           thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

19:075:002 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

19:075:003 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I
           bear up the pillars of it. Selah.

19:075:004 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
           Lift not up the horn:

19:075:005 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.

19:075:006 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
           nor from the south.

19:075:007 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
           another.

19:075:008 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is
           red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same:
           but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring
           them out, and drink them.

19:075:009 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
           Jacob.

19:075:010 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
           of the righteous shall be exalted.

19:076:001 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.

19:076:002 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in
           Zion.

19:076:003 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the
           sword, and the battle. Selah.

19:076:004 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of
           prey.

19:076:005 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and
           none of the men of might have found their hands.

19:076:006 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
           cast into a dead sleep.

19:076:007 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy
           sight when once thou art angry?

19:076:008 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
           feared, and was still,

19:076:009 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
           Selah.

19:076:010 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
           wrath shalt thou restrain.

19:076:011 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round
           about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

19:076:012 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
           kings of the earth.

19:077:001 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice;
           and he gave ear unto me.

19:077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
           night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

19:077:003 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my
           spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

19:077:004 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
           speak.

19:077:005 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

19:077:006 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with
           mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

19:077:007 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
           more?

19:077:008 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
           evermore?

19:077:009 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up
           his tender mercies? Selah.

19:077:010 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the
           years of the right hand of the most High.

19:077:011 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
           thy wonders of old.

19:077:012 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

19:077:013 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as
           our God?

19:077:014 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
           strength among the people.

19:077:015 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of
           Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

19:077:016 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
           afraid: the depths also were troubled.

19:077:017 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine
           arrows also went abroad.

19:077:018 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings
           lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.

19:077:019 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and
           thy footsteps are not known.

19:077:020 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
           Aaron.

19:078:001 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the
           words of my mouth.

19:078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings
           of old:

19:078:003 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

19:078:004 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
           generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength,
           and his wonderful works that he hath done.

19:078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law
           in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should
           make them known to their children:

19:078:006 That the generation to come might know them, even the children
           which should be born; who should arise and declare them to
           their children:

19:078:007 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the
           works of God, but keep his commandments:

19:078:008 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
           generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and
           whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

19:078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows,
           turned back in the day of battle.

19:078:010 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
           law;

19:078:011 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

19:078:012 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
           land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

19:078:013 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he
           made the waters to stand as an heap.

19:078:014 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the
           night with a light of fire.

19:078:015 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as
           out of the great depths.

19:078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
           run down like rivers.

19:078:017 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most
           High in the wilderness.

19:078:018 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
           lust.

19:078:019 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a
           table in the wilderness?

19:078:020 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
           streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide
           flesh for his people?

19:078:021 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
           kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

19:078:022 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
           salvation:

19:078:023 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
           doors of heaven,

19:078:024 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
           of the corn of heaven.

19:078:025 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

19:078:026 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
           he brought in the south wind.

19:078:027 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
           like as the sand of the sea:

19:078:028 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about
           their habitations.

19:078:029 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
           own desire;

19:078:030 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
           was yet in their mouths,

19:078:031 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
           and smote down the chosen men of Israel.

19:078:032 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
           wondrous works.

19:078:033 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
           in trouble.

19:078:034 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
           enquired early after God.

19:078:035 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
           their redeemer.

19:078:036 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
           lied unto him with their tongues.

19:078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
           stedfast in his covenant.

19:078:038 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
           destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
           and did not stir up all his wrath.

19:078:039 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that
           passeth away, and cometh not again.

19:078:040 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
           in the desert!

19:078:041 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy
           One of Israel.

19:078:042 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered
           them from the enemy.

19:078:043 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
           field of Zoan.

19:078:044 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
           they could not drink.

19:078:045 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
           and frogs, which destroyed them.

19:078:046 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
           labour unto the locust.

19:078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
           with frost.

19:078:048 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
           hot thunderbolts.

19:078:049 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
           indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.

19:078:050 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from
           death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

19:078:051 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
           strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

19:078:052 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided
           them in the wilderness like a flock.

19:078:053 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the
           sea overwhelmed their enemies.

19:078:054 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to
           this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

19:078:055 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
           inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in
           their tents.

19:078:056 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
           his testimonies:

19:078:057 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
           they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

19:078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and
           moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

19:078:059 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
           Israel:

19:078:060 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
           placed among men;

19:078:061 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
           the enemy's hand.

19:078:062 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth
           with his inheritance.

19:078:063 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
           given to marriage.

19:078:064 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
           lamentation.

19:078:065 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty
           man that shouteth by reason of wine.

19:078:066 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
           perpetual reproach.

19:078:067 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not
           the tribe of Ephraim:

19:078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

19:078:069 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
           which he hath established for ever.

19:078:070 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
           sheepfolds:

19:078:071 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to
           feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

19:078:072 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
           guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

19:079:001 O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
           temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

19:079:002 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat
           unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the
           beasts of the earth.

19:079:003 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
           and there was none to bury them.

19:079:004 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and
           derision to them that are round about us.

19:079:005 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy
           jealousy burn like fire?

19:079:006 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,
           and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

19:079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling
           place.

19:079:008 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
           mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

19:079:009 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name:
           and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.

19:079:010 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him
           be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of
           the blood of thy servants which is shed.

19:079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
           the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are
           appointed to die;

19:079:012 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
           their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

19:079:013 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee
           thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all
           generations.

19:080:001 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like
           a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine
           forth.

19:080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
           and come and save us.

19:080:003 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we
           shall be saved.

19:080:004 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
           prayer of thy people?

19:080:005 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them
           tears to drink in great measure.

19:080:006 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
           laugh among themselves.

19:080:007 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine;
           and we shall be saved.

19:080:008 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
           heathen, and planted it.

19:080:009 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take
           deep root, and it filled the land.

19:080:010 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
           thereof were like the goodly cedars.

19:080:011 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto
           the river.

19:080:012 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
           which pass by the way do pluck her?

19:080:013 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
           the field doth devour it.

19:080:014 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from
           heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

19:080:015 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
           branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

19:080:016 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
           rebuke of thy countenance.

19:080:017 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son
           of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

19:080:018 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
           upon thy name.

19:080:019 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine;
           and we shall be saved.

19:081:001 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
           God of Jacob.

19:081:002 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
           with the psaltery.

19:081:003 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
           our solemn feast day.

19:081:004 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of
           Jacob.

19:081:005 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
           through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I
           understood not.

19:081:006 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were
           delivered from the pots.

19:081:007 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered
           thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the
           waters of Meribah. Selah.

19:081:008 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
           thou wilt hearken unto me;

19:081:009 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou
           worship any strange god.

19:081:010 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
           Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

19:081:011 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
           none of me.

19:081:012 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked
           in their own counsels.

19:081:013 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
           in my ways!

19:081:014 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
           against their adversaries.

19:081:015 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
           him: but their time should have endured for ever.

19:081:016 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
           with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

19:082:001 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth
           among the gods.

19:082:002 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
           wicked? Selah.

19:082:003 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted
           and needy.

19:082:004 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
           wicked.

19:082:005 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
           darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

19:082:006 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the
           most High.

19:082:007 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

19:082:008 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
           nations.

19:083:001 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
           still, O God.

19:083:002 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
           have lifted up the head.

19:083:003 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and
           consulted against thy hidden ones.

19:083:004 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
           nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

19:083:005 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
           confederate against thee:

19:083:006 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
           Hagarenes;

19:083:007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
           inhabitants of Tyre;

19:083:008 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children
           of Lot. Selah.

19:083:009 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to
           Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

19:083:010 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.

19:083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
           princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

19:083:012 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
           possession.

19:083:013 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
           wind.

19:083:014 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
           mountains on fire;

19:083:015 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
           thy storm.

19:083:016 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
           LORD.

19:083:017 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
           put to shame, and perish:

19:083:018 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
           the most high over all the earth.

19:084:001 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

19:084:002 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
           LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

19:084:003 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest
           for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O
           LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.

19:084:004 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
           praising thee. Selah.

19:084:005 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart
           are the ways of them.

19:084:006 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the
           rain also filleth the pools.

19:084:007 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
           appeareth before God.

19:084:008 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
           Selah.

19:084:009 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
           anointed.

19:084:010 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had
           rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell
           in the tents of wickedness.

19:084:011 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace
           and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
           uprightly.

19:084:012 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

19:085:001 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast
           brought back the captivity of Jacob.

19:085:002 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast
           covered all their sin. Selah.

19:085:003 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself
           from the fierceness of thine anger.

19:085:004 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward
           us to cease.

19:085:005 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
           anger to all generations?

19:085:006 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
           thee?

19:085:007 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

19:085:008 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak
           peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not
           turn again to folly.

19:085:009 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory
           may dwell in our land.

19:085:010 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
           kissed each other.

19:085:011 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
           look down from heaven.

19:085:012 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land
           shall yield her increase.

19:085:013 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
           of his steps.

19:086:001 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

19:086:002 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy
           servant that trusteth in thee.

19:086:003 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

19:086:004 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I
           lift up my soul.

19:086:005 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous
           in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

19:086:006 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of
           my supplications.

19:086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
           answer me.

19:086:008 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither
           are there any works like unto thy works.

19:086:009 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
           thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

19:086:010 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
           alone.

19:086:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
           heart to fear thy name.

19:086:012 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I
           will glorify thy name for evermore.

19:086:013 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
           soul from the lowest hell.

19:086:014 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
           violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee
           before them.

19:086:015 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
           longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

19:086:016 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto
           thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

19:086:017 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,
           and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and
           comforted me.

19:087:001 His foundation is in the holy mountains.

19:087:002 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings
           of Jacob.

19:087:003 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

19:087:004 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
           behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born
           there.

19:087:005 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in
           her: and the highest himself shall establish her.

19:087:006 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
           man was born there. Selah.

19:087:007 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be
           there: all my springs are in thee.

19:088:001 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
           thee:

19:088:002 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;

19:088:003 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto
           the grave.

19:088:004 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a
           man that hath no strength:

19:088:005 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
           whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy
           hand.

19:088:006 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the
           deeps.

19:088:007 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with
           all thy waves. Selah.

19:088:008 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast
           made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot
           come forth.

19:088:009 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
           daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

19:088:010 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
           praise thee? Selah.

19:088:011 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
           faithfulness in destruction?

19:088:012 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness
           in the land of forgetfulness?

19:088:013 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall
           my prayer prevent thee.

19:088:014 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
           from me?

19:088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I
           suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

19:088:016 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

19:088:017 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
           about together.

19:088:018 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
           acquaintance into darkness.

19:089:001 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth
           will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

19:089:002 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
           faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

19:089:003 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David
           my servant,

19:089:004 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
           all generations. Selah.

19:089:005 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
           faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

19:089:006 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
           the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

19:089:007 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and
           to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

19:089:008 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or
           to thy faithfulness round about thee?

19:089:009 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof
           arise, thou stillest them.

19:089:010 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
           hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.

19:089:011 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the
           world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

19:089:012 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and
           Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.

19:089:013 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
           right hand.

19:089:014 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy
           and truth shall go before thy face.

19:089:015 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
           walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

19:089:016 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
           righteousness shall they be exalted.

19:089:017 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour
           our horn shall be exalted.

19:089:018 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
           king.

19:089:019 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I
           have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one
           chosen out of the people.

19:089:020 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I
           anointed him:

19:089:021 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
           strengthen him.

19:089:022 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
           afflict him.

19:089:023 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
           that hate him.

19:089:024 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my
           name shall his horn be exalted.

19:089:025 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
           rivers.

19:089:026 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
           of my salvation.

19:089:027 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of
           the earth.

19:089:028 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant
           shall stand fast with him.

19:089:029 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne
           as the days of heaven.

19:089:030 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

19:089:031 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

19:089:032 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
           iniquity with stripes.

19:089:033 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from
           him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

19:089:034 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
           out of my lips.

19:089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto
           David.

19:089:036 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun
           before me.

19:089:037 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a
           faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

19:089:038 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
           thine anointed.

19:089:039 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
           profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

19:089:040 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
           strong holds to ruin.

19:089:041 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
           neighbours.

19:089:042 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
           made all his enemies to rejoice.

19:089:043 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
           him to stand in the battle.

19:089:044 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
           the ground.

19:089:045 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered
           him with shame. Selah.

19:089:046 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy
           wrath burn like fire?

19:089:047 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all
           men in vain?

19:089:048 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
           deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

19:089:049 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou
           swarest unto David in thy truth?

19:089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
           my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

19:089:051 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith
           they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

19:089:052 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

19:090:001 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

19:090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
           formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
           everlasting, thou art God.

19:090:003 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye
           children of men.

19:090:004 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it
           is past, and as a watch in the night.

19:090:005 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
           in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.

19:090:006 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening
           it is cut down, and withereth.

19:090:007 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
           troubled.

19:090:008 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in
           the light of thy countenance.

19:090:009 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our
           years as a tale that is told.

19:090:010 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
           reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their
           strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly
           away.

19:090:011 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
           fear, so is thy wrath.

19:090:012 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
           unto wisdom.

19:090:013 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning
           thy servants.

19:090:014 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be
           glad all our days.

19:090:015 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
           us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.

19:090:016 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto
           their children.

19:090:017 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and
           establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of
           our hands establish thou it.

19:091:001 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall
           abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

19:091:002 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
           God; in him will I trust.

19:091:003 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
           from the noisome pestilence.

19:091:004 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings
           shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

19:091:005 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
           arrow that flieth by day;

19:091:006 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
           destruction that wasteth at noonday.

19:091:007 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
           right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

19:091:008 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of
           the wicked.

19:091:009 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
           most High, thy habitation;

19:091:010 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
           nigh thy dwelling.

19:091:011 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
           all thy ways.

19:091:012 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy
           foot against a stone.

19:091:013 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and
           the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

19:091:014 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
           him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

19:091:015 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with
           him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

19:091:016 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

19:092:001 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING
           PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:

19:092:002 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
           faithfulness every night,

19:092:003 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
           the harp with a solemn sound.

19:092:004 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
           triumph in the works of thy hands.

19:092:005 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very
           deep.

19:092:006 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand
           this.

19:092:007 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers
           of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed
           for ever:

19:092:008 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.

19:092:009 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
           perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

19:092:010 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I
           shall be anointed with fresh oil.

19:092:011 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine
           ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against
           me.

19:092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow
           like a cedar in Lebanon.

19:092:013 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish
           in the courts of our God.

19:092:014 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be
           fat and flourishing;

19:092:015 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is
           no unrighteousness in him.

19:093:001 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
           clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the
           world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

19:093:002 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.

19:093:003 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
           their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

19:093:004 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters,
           yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.

19:093:005 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house,
           O LORD, for ever.

19:094:001 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom
           vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.

19:094:002 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to
           the proud.

19:094:003 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
           triumph?

19:094:004 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
           workers of iniquity boast themselves?

19:094:005 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
           heritage.

19:094:006 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the
           fatherless.

19:094:007 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
           Jacob regard it.

19:094:008 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when
           will ye be wise?

19:094:009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the
           eye, shall he not see?

19:094:010 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
           teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?

19:094:011 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

19:094:012 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
           him out of thy law;

19:094:013 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
           until the pit be digged for the wicked.

19:094:014 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
           forsake his inheritance.

19:094:015 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
           upright in heart shall follow it.

19:094:016 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will
           stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

19:094:017 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
           silence.

19:094:018 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.

19:094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
           my soul.

19:094:020 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
           frameth mischief by a law?

19:094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the
           righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

19:094:022 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my
           refuge.

19:094:023 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut
           them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall
           cut them off.

19:095:001 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise
           to the rock of our salvation.

19:095:002 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
           joyful noise unto him with psalms.

19:095:003 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

19:095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of
           the hills is his also.

19:095:005 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
           land.

19:095:006 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the
           LORD our maker.

19:095:007 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and
           the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

19:095:008 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the
           day of temptation in the wilderness:

19:095:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

19:095:010 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
           It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not
           known my ways:

19:095:011 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into
           my rest.

19:096:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the
           earth.

19:096:002 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation
           from day to day.

19:096:003 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all
           people.

19:096:004 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be
           feared above all gods.

19:096:005 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made
           the heavens.

19:096:006 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in
           his sanctuary.

19:096:007 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
           LORD glory and strength.

19:096:008 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
           offering, and come into his courts.

19:096:009 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,
           all the earth.

19:096:010 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also
           shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall
           judge the people righteously.

19:096:011 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the
           sea roar, and the fulness thereof.

19:096:012 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall
           all the trees of the wood rejoice

19:096:013 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
           earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the
           people with his truth.

19:097:001 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
           isles be glad thereof.

19:097:002 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
           judgment are the habitation of his throne.

19:097:003 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round
           about.

19:097:004 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and
           trembled.

19:097:005 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
           presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

19:097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see
           his glory.

19:097:007 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
           themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.

19:097:008 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
           because of thy judgments, O LORD.

19:097:009 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
           far above all gods.

19:097:010 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of
           his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

19:097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright
           in heart.

19:097:012 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
           remembrance of his holiness.

19:098:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
           things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the
           victory.

19:098:002 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath
           he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

19:098:003 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
           Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of
           our God.

19:098:004 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
           noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

19:098:005 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice
           of a psalm.

19:098:006 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before
           the LORD, the King.

19:098:007 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
           that dwell therein.

19:098:008 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful
           together

19:098:009 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with
           righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with
           equity.

19:099:001 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between
           the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

19:099:002 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the
           people.

19:099:003 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

19:099:004 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
           equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

19:099:005 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for
           he is holy.

19:099:006 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
           call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered
           them.

19:099:007 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
           testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

19:099:008 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that
           forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their
           inventions.

19:099:009 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
           LORD our God is holy.

19:100:001 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

19:100:002 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
           singing.

19:100:003 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us,
           and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his
           pasture.

19:100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts
           with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

19:100:005 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
           endureth to all generations.

19:101:001 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
           sing.

19:101:002 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
           come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect
           heart.

19:101:003 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work
           of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

19:101:004 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
           person.

19:101:005 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off:
           him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I
           suffer.

19:101:006 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they
           may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall
           serve me.

19:101:007 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he
           that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

19:101:008 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may
           cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

19:102:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

19:102:002 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
           incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me
           speedily.

19:102:003 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned
           as an hearth.

19:102:004 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
           to eat my bread.

19:102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
           skin.

19:102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
           desert.

19:102:007 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

19:102:008 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
           against me are sworn against me.

19:102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
           weeping.

19:102:010 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
           lifted me up, and cast me down.

19:102:011 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
           like grass.

19:102:012 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
           unto all generations.

19:102:013 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
           favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

19:102:014 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
           dust thereof.

19:102:015 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
           kings of the earth thy glory.

19:102:016 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
           glory.

19:102:017 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
           their prayer.

19:102:018 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
           people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

19:102:019 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
           heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

19:102:020 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
           appointed to death;

19:102:021 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
           Jerusalem;

19:102:022 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
           serve the LORD.

19:102:023 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

19:102:024 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
           thy years are throughout all generations.

19:102:025 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
           heavens are the work of thy hands.

19:102:026 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
           shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
           them, and they shall be changed:

19:102:027 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

19:102:028 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
           shall be established before thee.

19:103:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless
           his holy name.

19:103:002 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

19:103:003 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
           diseases;

19:103:004 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee
           with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

19:103:005 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth
           is renewed like the eagle's.

19:103:006 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
           oppressed.

19:103:007 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children
           of Israel.

19:103:008 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and
           plenteous in mercy.

19:103:009 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
           ever.

19:103:010 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
           according to our iniquities.

19:103:011 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
           mercy toward them that fear him.

19:103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed
           our transgressions from us.

19:103:013 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth
           them that fear him.

19:103:014 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

19:103:015 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field,
           so he flourisheth.

19:103:016 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
           thereof shall know it no more.

19:103:017 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
           upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's
           children;

19:103:018 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
           commandments to do them.

19:103:019 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
           kingdom ruleth over all.

19:103:020 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
           his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

19:103:021 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
           do his pleasure.

19:103:022 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
           bless the LORD, O my soul.

19:104:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
           thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

19:104:002 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
           stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

19:104:003 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
           the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the
           wind:

19:104:004 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

19:104:005 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
           removed for ever.

19:104:006 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
           stood above the mountains.

19:104:007 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they
           hasted away.

19:104:008 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
           the place which thou hast founded for them.

19:104:009 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
           turn not again to cover the earth.

19:104:010 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
           hills.

19:104:011 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
           quench their thirst.

19:104:012 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
           which sing among the branches.

19:104:013 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is
           satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

19:104:014 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
           service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

19:104:015 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make
           his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.

19:104:016 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
           which he hath planted;

19:104:017 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
           trees are her house.

19:104:018 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
           for the conies.

19:104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
           down.

19:104:020 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
           of the forest do creep forth.

19:104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat
           from God.

19:104:022 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
           down in their dens.

19:104:023 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
           evening.

19:104:024 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
           them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

19:104:025 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
           innumerable, both small and great beasts.

19:104:026 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
           made to play therein.

19:104:027 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their
           meat in due season.

19:104:028 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
           they are filled with good.

19:104:029 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away
           their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

19:104:030 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
           renewest the face of the earth.

19:104:031 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
           rejoice in his works.

19:104:032 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
           hills, and they smoke.

19:104:033 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing
           praise to my God while I have my being.

19:104:034 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
           LORD.

19:104:035 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
           wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye
           the LORD.

19:105:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known
           his deeds among the people.

19:105:002 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his
           wondrous works.

19:105:003 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
           seek the LORD.

19:105:004 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

19:105:005 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
           and the judgments of his mouth;

19:105:006 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
           chosen.

19:105:007 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.

19:105:008 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
           commanded to a thousand generations.

19:105:009 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

19:105:010 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
           an everlasting covenant:

19:105:011 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
           your inheritance:

19:105:012 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
           strangers in it.

19:105:013 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
           another people;

19:105:014 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
           for their sakes;

19:105:015 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

19:105:016 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
           whole staff of bread.

19:105:017 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
           servant:

19:105:018 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

19:105:019 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
           him.

19:105:020 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people,
           and let him go free.

19:105:021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

19:105:022 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
           wisdom.

19:105:023 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land
           of Ham.

19:105:024 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
           than their enemies.

19:105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly
           with his servants.

19:105:026 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

19:105:027 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
           Ham.

19:105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
           against his word.

19:105:029 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

19:105:030 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers
           of their kings.

19:105:031 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in
           all their coasts.

19:105:032 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

19:105:033 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
           trees of their coasts.

19:105:034 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
           without number,

19:105:035 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
           fruit of their ground.

19:105:036 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of
           all their strength.

19:105:037 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
           not one feeble person among their tribes.

19:105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
           upon them.

19:105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in
           the night.

19:105:040 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
           with the bread of heaven.

19:105:041 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
           dry places like a river.

19:105:042 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

19:105:043 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
           gladness:

19:105:044 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
           labour of the people;

19:105:045 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.
           Praise ye the LORD.

19:106:001 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is
           good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

19:106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
           all his praise?

19:106:003 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
           righteousness at all times.

19:106:004 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto
           thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

19:106:005 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in
           the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine
           inheritance.

19:106:006 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,
           we have done wickedly.

19:106:007 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
           remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him
           at the sea, even at the Red sea.

19:106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
           make his mighty power to be known.

19:106:009 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led
           them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

19:106:010 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
           redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

19:106:011 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of
           them left.

19:106:012 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

19:106:013 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

19:106:014 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
           the desert.

19:106:015 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
           soul.

19:106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
           LORD.

19:106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
           company of Abiram.

19:106:018 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
           the wicked.

19:106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

19:106:020 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
           that eateth grass.

19:106:021 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
           Egypt;

19:106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
           Red sea.

19:106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
           his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his
           wrath, lest he should destroy them.

19:106:024 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
           word:

19:106:025 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
           of the LORD.

19:106:026 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow
           them in the wilderness:

19:106:027 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
           them in the lands.

19:106:028 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
           sacrifices of the dead.

19:106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
           plague brake in upon them.

19:106:030 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
           plague was stayed.

19:106:031 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
           generations for evermore.

19:106:032 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
           ill with Moses for their sakes:

19:106:033 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
           with his lips.

19:106:034 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
           commanded them:

19:106:035 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

19:106:036 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

19:106:037 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
           devils,

19:106:038 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
           their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of
           Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

19:106:039 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a
           whoring with their own inventions.

19:106:040 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his
           people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

19:106:041 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
           hated them ruled over them.

19:106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
           subjection under their hand.

19:106:043 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
           their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

19:106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
           cry:

19:106:045 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented
           according to the multitude of his mercies.

19:106:046 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
           captives.

19:106:047 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
           to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy
           praise.

19:106:048 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
           everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the
           LORD.

19:107:001 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:107:002 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed
           from the hand of the enemy;

19:107:003 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
           the west, from the north, and from the south.

19:107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found
           no city to dwell in.

19:107:005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

19:107:006 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he
           delivered them out of their distresses.

19:107:007 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to
           a city of habitation.

19:107:008 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:009 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry
           soul with goodness.

19:107:010 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being
           bound in affliction and iron;

19:107:011 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
           the counsel of the most High:

19:107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
           down, and there was none to help.

19:107:013 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
           them out of their distresses.

19:107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
           brake their bands in sunder.

19:107:015 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:016 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of
           iron in sunder.

19:107:017 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
           iniquities, are afflicted.

19:107:018 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
           unto the gates of death.

19:107:019 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
           them out of their distresses.

19:107:020 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
           their destructions.

19:107:021 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:022 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
           declare his works with rejoicing.

19:107:023 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
           great waters;

19:107:024 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

19:107:025 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
           up the waves thereof.

19:107:026 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
           their soul is melted because of trouble.

19:107:027 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
           at their wit's end.

19:107:028 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
           them out of their distresses.

19:107:029 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
           still.

19:107:030 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
           unto their desired haven.

19:107:031 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:032 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
           praise him in the assembly of the elders.

19:107:033 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
           dry ground;

19:107:034 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
           that dwell therein.

19:107:035 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry
           ground into watersprings.

19:107:036 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
           a city for habitation;

19:107:037 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield
           fruits of increase.

19:107:038 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
           and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

19:107:039 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
           affliction, and sorrow.

19:107:040 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander
           in the wilderness, where there is no way.

19:107:041 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh
           him families like a flock.

19:107:042 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity
           shall stop her mouth.

19:107:043 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
           understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.

19:108:001 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even
           with my glory.

19:108:002 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

19:108:003 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
           praises unto thee among the nations.

19:108:004 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth
           reacheth unto the clouds.

19:108:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
           all the earth;

19:108:006 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand,
           and answer me.

19:108:007 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
           Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

19:108:008 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
           of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

19:108:009 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
           Philistia will I triumph.

19:108:010 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
           Edom?

19:108:011 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
           O God, go forth with our hosts?

19:108:012 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

19:108:013 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
           tread down our enemies.

19:109:001 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

19:109:002 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
           opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying
           tongue.

19:109:003 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
           against me without a cause.

19:109:004 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
           prayer.

19:109:005 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my
           love.

19:109:006 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his
           right hand.

19:109:007 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
           prayer become sin.

19:109:008 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

19:109:009 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

19:109:010 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
           seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

19:109:011 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
           strangers spoil his labour.

19:109:012 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there
           be any to favour his fatherless children.

19:109:013 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
           let their name be blotted out.

19:109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
           and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

19:109:015 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
           the memory of them from the earth.

19:109:016 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
           the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in
           heart.

19:109:017 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
           not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

19:109:018 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
           so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into
           his bones.

19:109:019 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for
           a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

19:109:020 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
           of them that speak evil against my soul.

19:109:021 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
           because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

19:109:022 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

19:109:023 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up
           and down as the locust.

19:109:024 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
           fatness.

19:109:025 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
           they shaked their heads.

19:109:026 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

19:109:027 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD,
           hast done it.

19:109:028 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
           ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

19:109:029 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
           themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

19:109:030 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
           praise him among the multitude.

19:109:031 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
           from those that condemn his soul.

19:110:001 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
           make thine enemies thy footstool.

19:110:002 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule
           thou in the midst of thine enemies.

19:110:003 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
           beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast
           the dew of thy youth.

19:110:004 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest
           for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

19:110:005 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the
           day of his wrath.

19:110:006 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places
           with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many
           countries.

19:110:007 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he
           lift up the head.

19:111:001 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole
           heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the
           congregation.

19:111:002 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
           have pleasure therein.

19:111:003 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness
           endureth for ever.

19:111:004 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
           gracious and full of compassion.

19:111:005 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
           mindful of his covenant.

19:111:006 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
           give them the heritage of the heathen.

19:111:007 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
           commandments are sure.

19:111:008 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
           uprightness.

19:111:009 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
           covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

19:111:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
           understanding have all they that do his commandments: his
           praise endureth for ever.

19:112:001 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
           that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

19:112:002 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
           upright shall be blessed.

19:112:003 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
           endureth for ever.

19:112:004 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
           gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

19:112:005 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his
           affairs with discretion.

19:112:006 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be
           in everlasting remembrance.

19:112:007 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
           trusting in the LORD.

19:112:008 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
           his desire upon his enemies.

19:112:009 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his
           righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted
           with honour.

19:112:010 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
           his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall
           perish.

19:113:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
           the name of the LORD.

19:113:002 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
           evermore.

19:113:003 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
           LORD's name is to be praised.

19:113:004 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
           heavens.

19:113:005 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

19:113:006 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
           and in the earth!

19:113:007 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
           out of the dunghill;

19:113:008 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
           people.

19:113:009 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
           mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.

19:114:001 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a
           people of strange language;

19:114:002 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

19:114:003 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

19:114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
           lambs.

19:114:005 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
           that thou wast driven back?

19:114:006 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
           like lambs?

19:114:007 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
           presence of the God of Jacob;

19:114:008 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
           fountain of waters.

19:115:001 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give
           glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

19:115:002 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?

19:115:003 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
           pleased.

19:115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

19:115:005 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they
           see not:

19:115:006 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
           smell not:

19:115:007 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
           walk not: neither speak they through their throat.

19:115:008 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
           trusteth in them.

19:115:009 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their
           shield.

19:115:010 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
           their shield.

19:115:011 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
           their shield.

19:115:012 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will
           bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.

19:115:013 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

19:115:014 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
           children.

19:115:015 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.

19:115:016 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth
           hath he given to the children of men.

19:115:017 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
           silence.

19:115:018 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
           evermore. Praise the LORD.

19:116:001 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
           supplications.

19:116:002 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I
           call upon him as long as I live.

19:116:003 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
           hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

19:116:004 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech
           thee, deliver my soul.

19:116:005 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.

19:116:006 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he
           helped me.

19:116:007 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
           bountifully with thee.

19:116:008 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
           tears, and my feet from falling.

19:116:009 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

19:116:010 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

19:116:011 I said in my haste, All men are liars.

19:116:012 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
           me?

19:116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of
           the LORD.

19:116:014 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
           his people.

19:116:015 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.

19:116:016 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
           of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

19:116:017 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
           call upon the name of the LORD.

19:116:018 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
           his people.

19:116:019 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O
           Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

19:117:001 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.

19:117:002 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of
           the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.

19:118:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:118:002 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

19:118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
           ever.

19:118:004 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:118:005 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and
           set me in a large place.

19:118:006 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto
           me?

19:118:007 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore
           shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.

19:118:008 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
           man.

19:118:009 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
           princes.

19:118:010 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD
           will I destroy them.

19:118:011 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in
           the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

19:118:012 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the
           fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy
           them.

19:118:013 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD
           helped me.

19:118:014 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

19:118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
           the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

19:118:016 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
           LORD doeth valiantly.

19:118:017 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

19:118:018 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
           unto death.

19:118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them,
           and I will praise the LORD:

19:118:020 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

19:118:021 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
           salvation.

19:118:022 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
           of the corner.

19:118:023 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.

19:118:024 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
           be glad in it.

19:118:025 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send
           now prosperity.

19:118:026 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have
           blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

19:118:027 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the
           sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

19:118:028 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I
           will exalt thee.

19:118:029 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:119:001 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of
           the LORD.

19:119:002 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
           with the whole heart.

19:119:003 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.

19:119:004 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.

19:119:005 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!

19:119:006 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
           commandments.

19:119:007 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall
           have learned thy righteous judgments.

19:119:008 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.

19:119:009 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
           thereto according to thy word.

19:119:010 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
           from thy commandments.

19:119:011 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin
           against thee.

19:119:012 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.

19:119:013 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.

19:119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
           all riches.

19:119:015 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
           ways.

19:119:016 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
           word.

19:119:017 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
           thy word.

19:119:018 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
           thy law.

19:119:019 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from
           me.

19:119:020 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
           judgments at all times.

19:119:021 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
           thy commandments.

19:119:022 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
           testimonies.

19:119:023 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
           meditate in thy statutes.

19:119:024 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.

19:119:025 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to
           thy word.

19:119:026 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
           statutes.

19:119:027 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk
           of thy wondrous works.

19:119:028 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
           unto thy word.

19:119:029 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
           graciously.

19:119:030 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
           before me.

19:119:031 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to
           shame.

19:119:032 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt
           enlarge my heart.

19:119:033 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
           unto the end.

19:119:034 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
           observe it with my whole heart.

19:119:035 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do
           I delight.

19:119:036 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to
           covetousness.

19:119:037 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
           in thy way.

19:119:038 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy
           fear.

19:119:039 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are
           good.

19:119:040 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
           righteousness.

19:119:041 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
           according to thy word.

19:119:042 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
           for I trust in thy word.

19:119:043 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
           have hoped in thy judgments.

19:119:044 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.

19:119:045 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.

19:119:046 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will
           not be ashamed.

19:119:047 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
           loved.

19:119:048 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
           have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

19:119:049 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast
           caused me to hope.

19:119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
           quickened me.

19:119:051 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not
           declined from thy law.

19:119:052 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
           myself.

19:119:053 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
           forsake thy law.

19:119:054 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.

19:119:055 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have
           kept thy law.

19:119:056 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.

19:119:057 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
           words.

19:119:058 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto
           me according to thy word.

19:119:059 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

19:119:060 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

19:119:061 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
           forgotten thy law.

19:119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of
           thy righteous judgments.

19:119:063 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
           keep thy precepts.

19:119:064 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy
           statutes.

19:119:065 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
           thy word.

19:119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
           commandments.

19:119:067 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
           word.

19:119:068 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

19:119:069 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
           precepts with my whole heart.

19:119:070 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.

19:119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
           learn thy statutes.

19:119:072 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
           and silver.

19:119:073 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me
           understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

19:119:074 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
           have hoped in thy word.

19:119:075 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
           faithfulness hast afflicted me.

19:119:076 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
           according to thy word unto thy servant.

19:119:077 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
           law is my delight.

19:119:078 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
           without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.

19:119:079 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
           known thy testimonies.

19:119:080 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.

19:119:081 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.

19:119:082 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort
           me?

19:119:083 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not
           forget thy statutes.

19:119:084 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
           judgment on them that persecute me?

19:119:085 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy
           law.

19:119:086 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
           wrongfully; help thou me.

19:119:087 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
           precepts.

19:119:088 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
           testimony of thy mouth.

19:119:089 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

19:119:090 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast
           established the earth, and it abideth.

19:119:091 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
           are thy servants.

19:119:092 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
           perished in mine affliction.

19:119:093 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
           quickened me.

19:119:094 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.

19:119:095 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
           consider thy testimonies.

19:119:096 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
           exceeding broad.

19:119:097 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.

19:119:098 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
           enemies: for they are ever with me.

19:119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
           testimonies are my meditation.

19:119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
           precepts.

19:119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
           keep thy word.

19:119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
           me.

19:119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
           to my mouth!

19:119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
           every false way.

19:119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

19:119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
           righteous judgments.

19:119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
           thy word.

19:119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
           LORD, and teach me thy judgments.

19:119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
           law.

19:119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
           precepts.

19:119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they
           are the rejoicing of my heart.

19:119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
           unto the end.

19:119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.

19:119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.

19:119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments
           of my God.

19:119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me
           not be ashamed of my hope.

19:119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect
           unto thy statutes continually.

19:119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
           for their deceit is falsehood.

19:119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
           therefore I love thy testimonies.

19:119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
           judgments.

19:119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
           oppressors.

19:119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
           me.

19:119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
           righteousness.

19:119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
           thy statutes.

19:119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
           testimonies.

19:119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
           thy law.

19:119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
           gold.

19:119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
           be right; and I hate every false way.

19:119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
           them.

19:119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
           understanding unto the simple.

19:119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
           commandments.

19:119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
           do unto those that love thy name.

19:119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
           dominion over me.

19:119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
           precepts.

19:119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
           statutes.

19:119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
           law.

19:119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.

19:119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
           very faithful.

19:119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
           thy words.

19:119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.

19:119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.

19:119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
           is the truth.

19:119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy
           commandments are my delights.

19:119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
           understanding, and I shall live.

19:119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
           statutes.

19:119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.

19:119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
           thy word.

19:119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
           thy word.

19:119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,
           quicken me according to thy judgment.

19:119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from
           thy law.

19:119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.

19:119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
           founded them for ever.

19:119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget
           thy law.

19:119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy
           word.

19:119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
           statutes.

19:119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to
           thy judgments.

19:119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
           from thy testimonies.

19:119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
           not thy word.

19:119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,
           according to thy lovingkindness.

19:119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
           righteous judgments endureth for ever.

19:119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart
           standeth in awe of thy word.

19:119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.

19:119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.

19:119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
           judgments.

19:119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
           offend them.

19:119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
           commandments.

19:119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
           exceedingly.

19:119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways
           are before thee.

19:119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
           understanding according to thy word.

19:119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to
           thy word.

19:119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
           statutes.

19:119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments
           are righteousness.

19:119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.

19:119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
           delight.

19:119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
           judgments help me.

19:119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
           do not forget thy commandments.

19:120:001 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.

19:120:002 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
           tongue.

19:120:003 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto
           thee, thou false tongue?

19:120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

19:120:005 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
           of Kedar!

19:120:006 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.

19:120:007 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.

19:121:001 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
           help.

19:121:002 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.

19:121:003 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee
           will not slumber.

19:121:004 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor
           sleep.

19:121:005 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
           hand.

19:121:006 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

19:121:007 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve
           thy soul.

19:121:008 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
           this time forth, and even for evermore.

19:122:001 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
           the LORD.

19:122:002 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

19:122:003 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

19:122:004 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
           testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

19:122:005 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the
           house of David.

19:122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
           thee.

19:122:007 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

19:122:008 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace
           be within thee.

19:122:009 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.

19:123:001 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
           heavens.

19:123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
           masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
           mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that
           he have mercy upon us.

19:123:003 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
           exceedingly filled with contempt.

19:123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
           are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

19:124:001 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may
           Israel say;

19:124:002 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
           up against us:

19:124:003 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
           kindled against us:

19:124:004 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over
           our soul:

19:124:005 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

19:124:006 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
           teeth.

19:124:007 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
           the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

19:124:008 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and
           earth.

19:125:001 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which
           cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.

19:125:002 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is
           round about his people from henceforth even for ever.

19:125:003 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
           righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto
           iniquity.

19:125:004 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
           upright in their hearts.

19:125:005 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
           shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace
           shall be upon Israel.

19:126:001 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
           them that dream.

19:126:002 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
           singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done
           great things for them.

19:126:003 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

19:126:004 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

19:126:005 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

19:126:006 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
           doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
           him.

19:127:001 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that
           build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh
           but in vain.

19:127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat
           the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

19:127:003 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
           womb is his reward.

19:127:004 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
           the youth.

19:127:005 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
           not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the
           gate.

19:128:001 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in
           his ways.

19:128:002 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou
           be, and it shall be well with thee.

19:128:003 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
           house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

19:128:004 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
           LORD.

19:128:005 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the
           good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

19:128:006 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
           Israel.

19:129:001 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel
           now say:

19:129:002 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they
           have not prevailed against me.

19:129:003 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

19:129:004 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
           wicked.

19:129:005 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

19:129:006 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
           afore it groweth up:

19:129:007 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
           sheaves his bosom.

19:129:008 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
           upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

19:130:001 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

19:130:002 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice
           of my supplications.

19:130:003 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
           stand?

19:130:004 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
           feared.

19:130:005 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
           hope.

19:130:006 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
           morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

19:130:007 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,
           and with him is plenteous redemption.

19:130:008 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

19:131:001 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do
           I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for
           me.

19:131:002 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
           weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

19:131:003 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.

19:132:001 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:

19:132:002 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
           Jacob;

19:132:003 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go
           up into my bed;

19:132:004 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine
           eyelids,

19:132:005 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
           mighty God of Jacob.

19:132:006 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of
           the wood.

19:132:007 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his
           footstool.

19:132:008 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy
           strength.

19:132:009 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
           saints shout for joy.

19:132:010 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
           anointed.

19:132:011 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from
           it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

19:132:012 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I
           shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy
           throne for evermore.

19:132:013 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
           habitation.

19:132:014 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have
           desired it.

19:132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor
           with bread.

19:132:016 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints
           shall shout aloud for joy.

19:132:017 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a
           lamp for mine anointed.

19:132:018 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall
           his crown flourish.

19:133:001 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
           together in unity!

19:133:002 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
           upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the
           skirts of his garments;

19:133:003 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
           mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing,
           even life for evermore.

19:134:001 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which
           by night stand in the house of the LORD.

19:134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.

19:134:003 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.

19:135:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise
           him, O ye servants of the LORD.

19:135:002 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the
           house of our God.

19:135:003 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his
           name; for it is pleasant.

19:135:004 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for
           his peculiar treasure.

19:135:005 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above
           all gods.

19:135:006 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
           earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

19:135:007 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
           he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of
           his treasuries.

19:135:008 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

19:135:009 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
           upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

19:135:010 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

19:135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
           kingdoms of Canaan:

19:135:012 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel
           his people.

19:135:013 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD,
           throughout all generations.

19:135:014 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself
           concerning his servants.

19:135:015 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of
           men's hands.

19:135:016 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
           see not;

19:135:017 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath
           in their mouths.

19:135:018 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that
           trusteth in them.

19:135:019 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of
           Aaron:

19:135:020 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless
           the LORD.

19:135:021 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
           Praise ye the LORD.

19:136:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:136:002 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for
           ever.

19:136:003 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for
           ever.

19:136:004 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:005 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:006 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:007 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for
           ever:

19:136:008 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:010 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy
           endureth for ever:

19:136:011 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth
           for ever:

19:136:012 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:013 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy
           endureth for ever:

19:136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy
           endureth for ever:

19:136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:016 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:017 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for
           ever:

19:136:018 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:020 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:021 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth
           for ever:

19:136:022 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth
           for ever:

19:136:024 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:025 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:026 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
           when we remembered Zion.

19:137:002 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

19:137:003 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
           song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying,
           Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

19:137:004 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

19:137:005 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
           cunning.

19:137:006 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
           my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

19:137:007 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of
           Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation
           thereof.

19:137:008 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he
           be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

19:137:009 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
           against the stones.

19:138:001 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I
           sing praise unto thee.

19:138:002 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for
           thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified
           thy word above all thy name.

19:138:003 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst
           me with strength in my soul.

19:138:004 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when
           they hear the words of thy mouth.

19:138:005 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the
           glory of the LORD.

19:138:006 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly:
           but the proud he knoweth afar off.

19:138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me:
           thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine
           enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.

19:138:008 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O
           LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own
           hands.

19:139:001 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.

19:139:002 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
           understandest my thought afar off.

19:139:003 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
           with all my ways.

19:139:004 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou
           knowest it altogether.

19:139:005 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon
           me.

19:139:006 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
           attain unto it.

19:139:007 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee
           from thy presence?

19:139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed
           in hell, behold, thou art there.

19:139:009 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
           parts of the sea;

19:139:010 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
           hold me.

19:139:011 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night
           shall be light about me.

19:139:012 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth
           as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

19:139:013 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
           mother's womb.

19:139:014 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
           marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

19:139:015 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
           and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

19:139:016 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
           thy book all my members were written, which in continuance
           were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

19:139:017 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great
           is the sum of them!

19:139:018 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
           when I awake, I am still with thee.

19:139:019 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me
           therefore, ye bloody men.

19:139:020 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take
           thy name in vain.

19:139:021 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I
           grieved with those that rise up against thee?

19:139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

19:139:023 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
           thoughts:

19:139:024 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
           way everlasting.

19:140:001 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the
           violent man;

19:140:002 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they
           gathered together for war.

19:140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders'
           poison is under their lips. Selah.

19:140:004 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me
           from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my
           goings.

19:140:005 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread
           a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

19:140:006 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my
           supplications, O LORD.

19:140:007 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast
           covered my head in the day of battle.

19:140:008 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his
           wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

19:140:009 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the
           mischief of their own lips cover them.

19:140:010 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the
           fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

19:140:011 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil
           shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

19:140:012 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
           and the right of the poor.

19:140:013 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the
           upright shall dwell in thy presence.

19:141:001 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my
           voice, when I cry unto thee.

19:141:002 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the
           lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

19:141:003 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my
           lips.

19:141:004 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked
           works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their
           dainties.

19:141:005 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let
           him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not
           break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their
           calamities.

19:141:006 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall
           hear my words; for they are sweet.

19:141:007 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one
           cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.

19:141:008 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my
           trust; leave not my soul destitute.

19:141:009 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the
           gins of the workers of iniquity.

19:141:010 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal
           escape.

19:142:001 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the
           LORD did I make my supplication.

19:142:002 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
           trouble.

19:142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
           path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a
           snare for me.

19:142:004 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man
           that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my
           soul.

19:142:005 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my
           portion in the land of the living.

19:142:006 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from
           my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

19:142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the
           righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal
           bountifully with me.

19:143:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
           faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.

19:143:002 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight
           shall no man living be justified.

19:143:003 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
           down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as
           those that have been long dead.

19:143:004 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within
           me is desolate.

19:143:005 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I
           muse on the work of thy hands.

19:143:006 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after
           thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

19:143:007 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face
           from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

19:143:008 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in
           thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should
           walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.

19:143:009 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to
           hide me.

19:143:010 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is
           good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

19:143:011 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy
           righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

19:143:012 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them
           that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.

19:144:001 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to
           war, and my fingers to fight:

19:144:002 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;
           my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people
           under me.

19:144:003 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the
           son of man, that thou makest account of him!

19:144:004 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth
           away.

19:144:005 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains,
           and they shall smoke.

19:144:006 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine
           arrows, and destroy them.

19:144:007 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of
           great waters, from the hand of strange children;

19:144:008 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
           hand of falsehood.

19:144:009 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and
           an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

19:144:010 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth
           David his servant from the hurtful sword.

19:144:011 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children,
           whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
           hand of falsehood:

19:144:012 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that
           our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the
           similitude of a palace:

19:144:013 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store:
           that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in
           our streets:

19:144:014 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no
           breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in
           our streets.

19:144:015 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is
           that people, whose God is the LORD.

19:145:001 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name
           for ever and ever.

19:145:002 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for
           ever and ever.

19:145:003 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his
           greatness is unsearchable.

19:145:004 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall
           declare thy mighty acts.

19:145:005 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy
           wondrous works.

19:145:006 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I
           will declare thy greatness.

19:145:007 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
           and shall sing of thy righteousness.

19:145:008 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger,
           and of great mercy.

19:145:009 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all
           his works.

19:145:010 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall
           bless thee.

19:145:011 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
           power;

19:145:012 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
           glorious majesty of his kingdom.

19:145:013 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion
           endureth throughout all generations.

19:145:014 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those
           that be bowed down.

19:145:015 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their
           meat in due season.

19:145:016 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every
           living thing.

19:145:017 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
           works.

19:145:018 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
           call upon him in truth.

19:145:019 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
           hear their cry, and will save them.

19:145:020 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked
           will he destroy.

19:145:021 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh
           bless his holy name for ever and ever.

19:146:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

19:146:002 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto
           my God while I have any being.

19:146:003 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
           there is no help.

19:146:004 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
           very day his thoughts perish.

19:146:005 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose
           hope is in the LORD his God:

19:146:006 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein
           is: which keepeth truth for ever:

19:146:007 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food
           to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

19:146:008 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them
           that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:

19:146:009 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless
           and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

19:146:010 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
           generations. Praise ye the LORD.

19:147:001 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our
           God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

19:147:002 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the
           outcasts of Israel.

19:147:003 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

19:147:004 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by
           their names.

19:147:005 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
           infinite.

19:147:006 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to
           the ground.

19:147:007 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the
           harp unto our God:

19:147:008 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for
           the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

19:147:009 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
           cry.

19:147:010 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
           pleasure in the legs of a man.

19:147:011 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
           hope in his mercy.

19:147:012 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

19:147:013 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath
           blessed thy children within thee.

19:147:014 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
           finest of the wheat.

19:147:015 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
           very swiftly.

19:147:016 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like
           ashes.

19:147:017 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before
           his cold?

19:147:018 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
           to blow, and the waters flow.

19:147:019 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
           unto Israel.

19:147:020 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his
           judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.

19:148:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens:
           praise him in the heights.

19:148:002 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

19:148:003 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of
           light.

19:148:004 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above
           the heavens.

19:148:005 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and
           they were created.

19:148:006 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a
           decree which shall not pass.

19:148:007 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:

19:148:008 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
           word:

19:148:009 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

19:148:010 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

19:148:011 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
           the earth:

19:148:012 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

19:148:013 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
           excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

19:148:014 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
           saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto
           him. Praise ye the LORD.

19:149:001 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
           praise in the congregation of saints.

19:149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of
           Zion be joyful in their King.

19:149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises
           unto him with the timbrel and harp.

19:149:004 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify
           the meek with salvation.

19:149:005 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon
           their beds.

19:149:006 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
           sword in their hand;

19:149:007 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon
           the people;

19:149:008 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
           of iron;

19:149:009 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have
           all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.

19:150:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in
           the firmament of his power.

19:150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his
           excellent greatness.

19:150:003 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the
           psaltery and harp.

19:150:004 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with
           stringed instruments and organs.

19:150:005 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high
           sounding cymbals.

19:150:006 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye
           the LORD.

indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.
