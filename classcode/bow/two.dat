        americans dead  if you hear nothing else i say tonight  hear this  anyone who s responsible for not taking control   in fact  not saying  i take no responsibility  initially   anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the united states of america  we re in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day  a thousand deaths a day  and there are over        new cases per day  compared to what s going on in europe  as the new england medical journal said  they re starting from a very low rate  we re starting from a very high rate  the expectation is we ll have another         americans dead by the time  between now and the end of the year  if we just wore these masks   the president s own advisors told them   we could save         lives  and we re in a circumstance where the president  thus far  still has no plan  no comprehensive plan  what i would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask  all the time  i would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing  investing in rapid testing  i would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe  and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that  we re in a situation now where the new england medical journal   one of the serious  most serious journals in the whole world   said for the first time ever that this  the way this president has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic  and so folks  i will take care of this  i will end this  i will make sure we have a plan   make sure it s totally transparent  have the scientific world see  know  look at it  go through all the processes  and by the way  this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by easter last time  this the same fellow who told you that  don t worry  we re going to end this by the summer  we re about to go into a dark winter  a dark winter  and he has no clear plan and there s no prospect that there s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the american people before the middle of next year   my responses is  he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from china  and he did it late  after    countries had already done that  in addition to that  what he did  he made sure that we had    people that were in there  in china  trying to get to wuhan to determine what exactly the source was  what did the president say in january  he said no  he said  this is   he s being transparent  the president of china is being transparent  we owe hkim a debt of gratitude  we have to thank him  and then what happened was  we started talking about using the defense act  to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people  and again  i go back to this  he had nothing  he did virtually nothing  and then he gets out of the hospital  and he talks about we re  this is   oh  don t worry  this is all going to be over soon   come on  there s not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it s going to be over soon   can i respond to that   number one  he says that we re  you know  we re learning to live with it  people are learning to die with it  you folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning  that man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their  out of habit  where their wife or husband was  is gone  learning to live with it  come on  we re dying with it  because he s never said   he said it s dangerous  when s the last time  is it really dangerous  still  are we dangerous  tell the people  is it dangerous now  what should they do about the danger  and you say  i take no responsibility    the fact is  when we knew it was coming  when it hit   what happened  what did the president say  he said don t worry  it s going to go away  it s going to be gone by easter  don t worry  the warm weather  don t worry  maybe inject bleach   he said he was kidding when he said that  but a lot of people thought it was serious  a whole range of things the president said  and even today  he thinks we are in control  we re about to lose         more people  i didn t say either of those things   i talked about his xenophobia in a different context  it wasn t about closing the border to chinese coming to the united states   no   what i would say is i m going to shut down the virus  not the country  it s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part   why businesses have gone under  why schools are closed  why so many people have lost their living and why they re concerned  those other concerns are real  that s why he should have been   instead of in a sand trap at his golf course   he should have been negotiating with nancy pelosi and the rest of the democrats and republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity   oh no  i m not shutting down the nation but there are  look  they need standards  the standard is  if you have a reproduction rate in a community that s above a certain level  everybody says  slow up  more social distancing  do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums  do not open until you get this under control  under more control  but when you do open  give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely  for example schools   schools  they need a lot of money to open  they need to deal with ventilation systems  they need to deal with smaller classes  more teacher  more pods  and he s refused to support that money  or at least up to now  simply not true  we re gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time  we ought to be able to safely open  but we need resources to open  you need to be able to  for example  if you re gonna open a business  have social distancing within the business  you need to have  if you have a restaurant  you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another  you need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is  in fact  infected  you need to be able to trace  you need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we re going to make sure that we open safely  and by the way  all you teachers out there   not that many of you are going to die  so don t worry about it  don t worry about it  come on   take a look what new york has done in terms of turning the curve down  in terms of the number of people dying  and i don t look at this in terms of what he does  blue states and red states  they re all the united states  and look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus  they re the red states  they are the states in the midwest  they are the states in the upper midwest  that s where the spike is occurring significantly  but they re all americans  they re all americans and what we have to do is say  wear these masks  number one  make sure we get the help that the businesses need  the money s already been passed to do that  it s been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing s happened    my response is think about what the president knew in january and didn t tell the american people  he was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air  and it was much worse than   much worse   than the flu  he went on record and said to one of your colleagues  recorded  that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn t want to tell us  didn t want to tell us because he didn t want us to panic  he didn t want us   americans don t panic  he panicked  well  guess what  in the meantime  we find out in the new york times the other day that in fact  his folks went to wall street and said   this is a really dangerous thing   and a memo out of that meeting   not from his administration  but from some of the brokers   had said   sell short  because we gotta get moving  it s a dangerous problem     average contribution         i made it clear  and i asked everyone else to take the pledge  i made it clear that any country  no matter who it is  that interferes in american elections will pay a price  they will pay the price  it has been overwhelmingly clear in this election   i won t even get into the last one   this election  that russia has been involved  china has been involved to some degree  and now we learned that  that iran is involved  they will pay a price if i m elected  interfering with american sovereignty  that s what s going on right now  they re interfering with american sovereignty  and to the best of my knowledge  i don t think the president said anything to putin about it  i don t think he s talking a lot  i don t think he said a word  i don t know why he hasn t said a word to putin about it  and i don t know what he has recently said  if anything  to the iranians  my guess is he d probably be more outspoken with regard to the iranians  but the point is this  folks  we are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election  his own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy   well  i won t  i shouldn t   i will   his buddy rudy giuliani  he s being used as a russian pawn  he s being fed information that is russian  that is not true  and then what happens  nothing happens  and then you find out that everything is going on here about russia is wanting to make sure that i do not get elected the next president of the united states because they know i know them  and they know me  i don t understand why this president is unwilling to take on putin when he s actually paying bounties to kill american soldiers in afghanistan  when he s engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of nato  i don t know why he doesn t do it but it s worth asking the question  why isn t that being done  any country that interferes with us will  in fact  pay a price because they re affecting our sovereignty    i have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life  we learn that this president paid    times the tax in china  as a secret bank account with china  does business in china  and in fact  is talking about me taking money  i have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever  ever  number one  number two  this is a president   i have released all of my tax returns     years  go look at them     years of my tax return  you have not released a single solitary year of your tax return  what are you hiding  why are you unwilling  the foreign countries are paying you a lot  russia is paying you a lot  china is paying a lot  and your hotels and all your businesses all around the country  all around the world  and china s building a new road to a new gas  a golf course you have overseas  so what s going on here  why don t you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption   at some point i want to respond   why do he   he s been saying this for four years  show us  just show us  stop playing around  you ve been saying for four years you re going to release your taxes  nobody knows  mr  president  they do know is you re not paying your taxes or you re paying taxes that are so low  when last time he said what he paid  he said   i only pay that little because i m smart  i know how to game the system   come on  come on  folks   nothing was unethical  here s what the deal  with regard to ukraine  we had this whole question about whether or not  because he was on the board  i later learned  of burisma  a company  that somehow i had done something wrong  yet every single solitary person  when he was going through his impeachment  testifying under oath who worked for him  said i did my job impeccably  i carried out us policy  not one  single  solitary thing was out of line  not a single thing  number one  number two  the guy who got in trouble in ukraine was this guy  trying to bribe the ukrainian government to say something negative about me  which they would not do  and did not do  because it never  ever  ever happened  my son has not made money in terms of this thing about   what are you talking about   china  i have not had it  the only guy that made money from china is this guy  he s the only one  nobody else has made money from china    no basis for that  everybody investigated that  no one said anything he did was wrong in ukraine    what i d make china do is play by the international rules  not like he has done  he has caused the deficit in china to go up not down   with china  go up not down  we are making sure that in order to do business in china  you have to give all your intellectual property  you have to get have a partner in china  it is      we would not do that at all  number one  number two  we re in a situation where china would have to play by the rules internationally as well  when i met with xi  and when i was still vice president  he said  we re setting up air identification zones in the south china sea  you can t fly through them   i said   we re gonna fly through them  we just flew b   b  bombers through it  we re not going to pay attention   they have to play by the rules  and what s he do  he embraces guys like the thugs like in north korea  and  and  and the chinese president and putin and others  and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends  all of our allies  we make up only   we  re          of the world s economy  we need to be having the rest of our friends with us  saying to china  these are the rules  you play by them or you re going to pay the price for not paying by them  economically  that s the way i will run it  and that s what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president    not true   that is not true   taxpayers money   taxpayers money   not true   this isn t about me  there s a reason why he s bringing up all this malarkey  there s a reason for it  he doesn t want to talk about the substantive issues  it s not about his family and my family  it s about your family  and your family s hurting badly  if you re making less than  if you re a middle class family  you re getting hurt badly right now  you re sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding  well  we can t get new tires  they re bald  because we have to wait another month  or  so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage  who s going to tell her  she can t go back to community college  they re the decisions you re making in the middle class families like i grew up in scranton and claymot  they re in trouble  we should be talking about your families but that s the last thing he wants to talk about   because i d make it clear  which we were making clear to china  they had to be part of the deal  because here s the root  i made it clear  as a spokesperson for the administration when i went to china  they said   why are you moving your missile defense up so close  why are you moving more forces  why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with south korea   i said   because north korea is a problem  and we re going to continue to do it so we can control them  we re going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us  and so if you want to do something about it  step up  and help if not  it s going to continue   what has he done  he s legitimized north korea  he s talked about his good buddy who s a thug  a thug  and he talks about how we re better off  and they have much more capable missiles  able to reach u s  territory  much more easily than ever did before    on the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there  the korean peninsula should be a nuclear free zone    we had a good relationship with hitler before he in fact invaded europe  the rest of europe  come on  the reason he would not meet with president obama is because president obama said we re gonna talk about denuclearization  we re not gonna legitimize you  we re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you  that s why he wouldn t meet with us   what i m going to do is pass obamacare with a public option    become bidencare  public option is an option that says that if you  in fact  do not have the wherewithal to be    if you qualify for medicaid  and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get medicaid  you automatically are enrolled  providing competition for insurance companies  that s what s going to happen  secondly  we re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there s competition that doesn t exist now by allowing medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies  thirdly  the idea that i want to eliminate private insurance    the reason why i had such a fight for  with    candidates for the nomination  was i support private insurance  that s why i did not    not one single person  private insurance  would lose their insurance under my plan  nor did they under obamacare  they did not lose their insurance  unless they chose they wanted to go to something else  lastly  we re going to make sure we re in a situation that we ve actually protect pre existing    there s no way he can protect pre existing conditions  none  zero  you can t do it in the ether  he s been talking about this for a long time  there is no    he s never come up with a plan  i guess we re gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since                 the fact that    i still have a little  a few more minutes  i know you re getting anxious    the fact is that he s already cost the american people because of his terrible handling of the covid virus and economic spillover     million people have lost their private insurance  and he wants to take away    million more people who have been under obamacare  and over     million people with pre existing conditions  and all the people from covid are going to have pre existing conditions  what are they going to do    what he s saying  it s ridiculous  it s like saying that  you know  we re the idea that  the fact that there s a public option that people can choose  that makes the socialist plan  look  the difference between the president    i think health care is not a privilege  it s a right  everyone should have the right to have affordable health care  and i am very proud of my plan  it s gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as  as well as a whole range of other people who in fact  are concerned in the medical field  this is something that s going to save people s lives  and this is going to give some people an opportunity  an opportunity to have health care for their children  how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in god s name are you going to do if you get sick  because you ve lost your home insurance  your health insurance  your company s gone under  we have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate  and that s what i do    my response is people deserve to have affordable health care    period  period  period  period  and the bidencare proposal will  in fact  provide for that affordable health care  lower premiums  what we re going to do is going to cost some money  it s going to cost over      billion over    years to do it  and they re going to have lower premiums  you can buy into the better plans  the cheaper plans  lower your premiums  deal with unexpected billing  and have your drug prices drop significantly  he keeps talking about it  he hasn t done a thing for anybody on health care  not a thing    he thinks he s running against someone else  he s running against joe biden  i beat all those other people because i disagreed with them  joe biden  he s running against  and the idea that we re in a situation and want to destroy medicare    this is the guy that the actuary of medicare said   if in fact     and  social security     if  in fact  he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on social security  social security will be bankrupt by       with no way to pay for it  this is a guy who s tried to cut medicare  so i don t know  i mean  the idea that donald trump is lecturing me on social security and medicare  come on    may i respond    the idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what s happening  where i come from  in scranton and claymont  the people don t live off of the stock market  just in the last three  three years during this crisis  the billionaires in this country made  according to the wall street       billion more dollars       billion more dollars  because that s his only measure  what happens to the ordinary people out there  what happens to them    you know  the republican leader in the united states senate said he can t    he will not pass it  he does not have republican votes  why isn t he talking to his republican friends    well  i have and they have pushed it  look  they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer  this is like    it s not new  it s been out there  the heroes act has been sitting there  and look at what s happening  when i was in charge of the recovery act with      billion  i was able to get      billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets  so then they have to fire fire    they have to fire firefighters  teachers  first responders  law enforcement officers  so they can keep their cities and counties running  he will not support that  they have not done a thing for them  and mitch mcconnell said   let him go bankrupt  let him go bankrupt   come on  what s the matter with these      all right  if i get elected  i m not gonna    i m running as a proud democrat  but i m gonna be an american president  i don t see red states and blue states  what i see is american united states  and folks  every single state out there finds themselves in trouble  they re going to start laying off  whether they re red or blue  cops  firefighters  first responders  teachers    because they have to balance their budget  and the founders were smart  they allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the united states of america    i do  because i think one of the things we re gonna have to do is we re gonna have to bail them out  too  we should be bailing them out now  those small businesses  you ve got one in six of them going under  they re not going to be able to make it back  they passed a package that allows us to be able to call ppp  money that s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely  schools  how they can make classrooms smaller  how they can hire more teachers  how they can put ventilation systems in  they need the help  the businesses  as well as the schools  need the help  but this  these guys will not help them  he is not giving them any of the money    two jobs  one job below poverty  people are making         bucks an hour  these first responders we all clap for as they come down the street  because they ve allowed us to make it  what s happening  they deserve a minimum wage of      anything below that put you below the poverty level  and there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage  business has gone out of business  that is simply not true    these     plus kids came with parents  they separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with  big real tough  really strong  and guess what  they cannot    it s not coyotes that bring them over  their parents were with them  they got separated from their parents  and it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation   so let s talk about     let s talk about what we re talking about  what happened  parents were ripped    their kids were ripped from their arms and separated  and now they cannot find over     sets of those parents and those kids are alone  nowhere to go  nowhere to go  it s criminal  it s criminal    because we made a mistake  it took too long to get it right  too long to get it right  i ll be president of the united states  not vice president of the united states  and the fact is  and i ve made it very clear  within     days  i m going to send to the united states congress a pathway to citizenship for over    million undocumented people  and all those so called dreamers  those daca kids  they re going to be legally certified again  to be able to stay in this country  and put on a path to citizenship  the idea that they are being sent home by this guy  and they want to do  that is they go to a country they ve never seen before  i can imagine you re five years old  your parents are taking you across the rio grande river and it s and it s illegal  you say  oh  no  mom  leave me here  i m not gonna go with you   they ve been here  many of them are model citizens         are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis  we owe them  we owe them   the catch and release  you know what he s talking about there  if in fact  you had family  came across  they re arrested  they  in fact  were given a date to show up for their hearing  they were released  and guess what  they showed up for the hearing  this is the first president in the history of the united states of america that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country  that s never happened before  that s never happened before in our country  you come to the united states and you make your case  that s how you seek asylum  based on the following premise  why i deserve it under american law  they re sitting in squalor on the other side of the river   not true    i know the law  what he s telling you is simply not true    check it out    you have     kids not knowing where in god s name they re going to be and lost their parents   i do  i do  you know  my daughter is a social worker  and she s written a lot about this  she s got a graduate degree from the university of pennsylvania in social work  so  one of the reasons why i ended up working on the east side of wilmington  delaware  which is    percent african american  was to learn more about what was going on  when i didn t    i never had to tell my daughter if she s pulled over  make sure she puts  for traffic stop  puts both hands on top of the wheel  and don t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you  but a black parent  no matter how wealthy or how poor they are  has to teach their child  when you re walking down the street  don t have a hoodie on when you go across the street  making sure that you  in fact  if you get pulled over  just yes or no sir  just hands on top of the wheel  because you are in fact  the victim  whether you re a person making                     a year person  or someone who s on food stamps  the fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in america  and we have always said we ve never lived up to it  do we hold these truths to be sovereign  are all men and women are created equal  guess what    we have never ever lived up to it  we have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion  this is the first president come along and says that s the end of that  we re not going to do that anymore  we have to provide for economic opportunity  better education  better health care  better access to schooling  better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses  all the things we can do  and i ve laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things  just to give people a shot  it s about accumulating the ability to have wealth  as well as it is to be free from violence    my response to that is i never  ever said what he accused me of saying  the fact of the matter is  in      though  after the crime bill had been in the law for a while  this is the guy who said   the problem with the crime bill  there s not enough people in jail  there s not enough people in jail   and go on my website  get the quote the date when he said it   not enough people   he talked about marauding gangs  young gangs  the people who are going to mauraud our cities  this is a guy who when the central park five  five innocent black kids  he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty  none of them were   none of them were guilty of what the crime  of the crimes that were suggested  look  and talk about he  granted  he did in fact let    people   he committed    people s sentences  we committed over       people s sentences  over        the very law he s talking about is a law that  in fact  initiated by barack obama  and secondly  we re in a situation here where we   the federal prison system was reduced by        people under our administration  and one of the things we should be doing is there should be no  no minimum mandatories in the law  that s why i m offering     billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts  nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem  they should be going to rehabilitation  not to jail  we should fundamentally change the system and that s what i m going to do    i am not    we did    well  i ll tell you what  i hope he does look at me because what s happening here is you know who i am  you know who he is  you know his character  you know my character  you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth  i am anxious to have this race  i m anxious to see this take place  i am   the character of the country is on the ballot  our character is on the ballot  look at us closely    nobody says    nobody   kristen  i have to respond to that   look  there are    former national intelligence folks who said that what this  he s accusing me of is a russian plan  they have said that this has all the characteristics   four   five former heads of the cia  both parties  say what he s saying is a bunch of garbage  nobody believes it except him  his   and his good friend rudy giuliani    that s exactly what   that s exactly what      abraham lincoln  here is one of the most racist presidents we ve had in modern history  he pours fuel on every single racist fire  every single one  he started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he s gonna get rid of those mexican rapists  he s banned muslims because they re muslims  he has moved around and made everything worse across the board  he says to them about the  poor boys   last time we were on stage here  he said   i told him to stand down and stand ready   come on  this guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn   you said you were abraham lincoln   oh  god    one of the things that is said  in the    s  we passed       all     senators voted for it  a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs  it was a mistake  i ve been trying to change it since then  particularly the portion on cocaine  that s why i ve been arguing that  in fact  we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense  they should be going into treatment across the board  that s what we should be spending money on  that s why i set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends  they should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem  they should be going into treatment  treatment  that s what we ve been trying to do  that s what i m going to get done because they may   the american people have now seen that in fact  it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug  but they were not in the crime bill    we got a lot of it done  we released          we got        prisoners left from            prisoners were released from federal prison  we have   there were over      people who were given clemency  we   in fact  we re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing  how they were conducting themselves  i could go on  but we began the process  we began the process  we lost an election  that s why i m running to win back that election and change his terrible policy    we had a republican congress  that s the answer   climate change  climate warming  global warming is an existential threat to humanity  we have a moral obligation to deal with it  and we re told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don t have much time  we re going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to    years  four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate  to clean up   to limit the   limit of admissions will put us in a position where we re going to be in real trouble  here s where we have a great opportunity  i was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor  people worried about jobs  to support my climate plan  because what it does  it will create millions of new  good paying jobs  we re going to invest in  for example                    excuse me         charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future  in the meantime  china s doing that  we re going to be in a position where we re going to see to it that we re going to take   million existing billion  buildings and   million existing homes and retrofit them so they don t leak as much energy  saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs  and by the way  the whole idea of what this is all going to do  it s going to create millions of jobs and it s going to clean the environment  our health and our jobs are at stake  that s what s happening  and we   right now  by the way  wall street firm has indicated that my plan   my plan will  in fact  create      million jobs    million more than his  this from wall street and i ll create    trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does  not on climate just on the economy    i don t know where he comes from  i don t know where he comes up with these numbers       trillion  give me a break  this plan was   this plan has been endorsed by every major   every major environmental group and every labor group  labor  because they know the future lies  the future lies in us being able to breath  and they know they re good jobs in getting us there  and by the way  the fastest growing industry in america are  is  is  is the electric  excuse me  solar energy and wind  he thinks wind causes cancer  windmills  it s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages        bucks an hour  we can grow and we can be cleaner  if we go the route i m proposing   find me a scientist that says that   false   i have never said i oppose fracking    i did  show the tape  put it on your website    put it on the website  the fact of the matter is he s flat lying    i do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need   we need other industries to transition to get to  ultimately   a complete zero emissions by       what i will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking  capture the emissions from gas  we can do that and we can do that by investing money into   it s a transition to that   fracking on federal land  i said  no fracking or oil on federal land    my response is that those people live on what they call  fence lines   he doesn t understand this  they live near chemical plants that  in fact  pollute   chemical plants  and oil plants and refineries that pollute  i used to live near that when i was growing up in claremont  delaware  and all the more oil refineries in marcus hook and the delaware river than there is anyplace  including in houston at the time  when my mom would get the car when they re first frost to drive me to school  turned on the windshield wipers there d be oil slick in the window  that s why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer  the fact is those frontline communities  it doesn t matter what you re paying them  it matters how you keep them safe  what do you do  and you impose restrictions on the pollution  that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities   i would transition from the oil industry  yes    it is a big statement because i would stop    because the oil industry significantly   but here s the deal    well  if you let me finish the statement  because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time  over time  and i d stop giving to the oil industry   i d stop giving them federal subsidies  you won t give federal subsidies to the gas and  excuse me  to solar and wind   why are we giving it to the oil industry   he takes everything out of context  but the point is  look  we have to move toward a net zero emissions  the first place to do that by the year      is in energy production  by       totally    no  i m going to rejoin the paris accord and get china to abide by what they agreed to  i will say   i m the american president  i represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me  and i m going to make sure that you re represented  i m going to give you hope  we re going to move  we re going to choose science over fiction  we re going to choose hope over fear  we re going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities  enormous opportunities to make things better   we can grow this economy  we can deal with a systemic racism  at the same time  we can make sure that our economy is being run  and moved  and motivated by clean energy  creating millions of new jobs  and that s the fact  that s what we re going to do  and i m going to say  as i said at the beginning  what is on the ballot here is the character of this country  decency  honor  respect  treating people with dignity  making sure that everyone has an even chance  now  i m going to make sure you get that  you haven t been getting it the last four years
