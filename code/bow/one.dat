so  as you know  more     million people  modeled out  were expected to die  we closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from china  it s a worldwide pandemic  it s all over the world  you see the spikes in europe and many other places right now  if you notice  the mortality rate is down       the excess mortality rate is way down  and much lower than almost any other country  and we re fighting it and we re fighting it hard  there is a spike  there was a spike in florida  and it s now gone  there was a very big spike in texas  it s now gone  there was a very big spike in arizona  it s now gone  and there were some spikes and surges in other places  they will soon be gone  we have a vaccine that s coming  it s ready  it s going to be announced within weeks  and it s going to be delivered  we have operation warp speed  which is the military  is going to distribute the vaccine  i can tell you from personal experience that i was in the hospital  i had it  and i got better and i will tell you that i had something that they gave me   a therapeutic  i guess they would call it  some people could say it was a cure  but i was in for a short period of time and i got better very fast or i wouldn t be here tonight  and now they say i m immune  whether it s four months or a lifetime  nobody s been able to say that  but i m immune  more and more people are getting better  we have a problem that s a worldwide problem  this is a worldwide problem  but i ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we ve been able to do with the   if you take a look at what we ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else  and in particular  ventilators  we re now making ventilators  all over the world  thousands and thousands a month  distributing them all over the world  it will go away and as i say  we re rounding the turn  we re rounding the corner  it s going away    it is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year  but i think it has a good chance  one or two companies  i think  within a matter of weeks  and it will be distributed very quickly   johnson and johnson is doing very well  moderna is doing very well  pfizer is doing very well  and we have numerous others  and then we also have others that we re working on very closely with other countries  in particular europe   no  i think my timeline is going to be more accurate  i don t know that they re counting on the military the way i do  but we have our generals lined up  one in particular  that s the head of logistics  and this is a very easy distribution for him  he s ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine  and we expect to have     million vials as soon as we have the vaccine  he s ready to go   i don t think it s going to be a dark winter at all  we re opening up our country  we ve learned and studied and understand the disease  which we didn t know at the beginning  when i closed and banned china from coming in heavily infected  and then ultimately europe  but china was in january   months later he was saying i was xenophobic  i did it too soon  now he s saying   oh  i should have  i should have  you know  moved quicker   but he didn t move quicker  he was months behind me  many months behind me  and frankly  he ran the h n  swine flu  and it was a total disaster  far less lethal  but it was a total disaster  had that had this kind of numbers          people would be dead right now  but it was a far less lethal disease  look  his own person who ran that for him who  as you know was his chief of staff  said  it was catastrophic  it was horrible  we didn t know what we were doing   now he comes up and he tells us how to do this  also everything that he said about the way   every single move that he said we should make   that s what we ve done  we ve done all of it  but he was way behind us   i did not say over soon  i say we re learning to live with it  we have no choice  we can t lock ourselves up in a basement like joe does  he has the ability to lock himself up  i don t know  he s obviously made a lot of money  someplace  but he has this thing about living in a basement  people can t do that  by the way  i  as the president  couldn t do that  i d love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the white house and go away for a year and a half until it disappears  i can t do that  and here s   every  every meeting i had   every meeting i had   and i meet a lot of families  including gold star families and military families  every meeting i had   and i had to meet them  i had to  it would be horrible to have canceled everything  i said  you know  this is dangerous  and you catch it  and you know  i caught it  i learned a lot  i learned a lot  great doctors  great hospitals  and now  i recovered       of young people recover      of people recover  we have to recover  we can t close up our nation  we have to open our school  and we can t close up our nation  or you re not going to have a nation    excuse me   i take full responsibility  it s not my fault that it came here  it s china s fault  you know what  it s not joe s fault that it came here either  it s china s fault  they kept it from going into the rest of china  for the most part  but they didn t keep it from coming out to the world including europe and ourselves  look  perhaps just to finish this  i was kidding on that but just to finish this  when i closed  he said  i shouldn t have closed  and that went on for months  what nancy pelosi said the same thing  she was dancing on the streets in chinatown in san francisco  but when i closed  he said  this is a terrible thing  you re xenophobic  i think he called me racist  even  and because i was closing it to china  now he says i should have closed it earlier  it just joe  it doesn t     you certainly did   he thought i shouldn t have closed the border  that s obvious   well  i think we have to respond  if i might   thank you  and i appreciate that  look  all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him  his democrat governors   cuomo in new york  you look at what s going on in california  you look at pennsylvania  north carolina  democrats  democrats all   they are shut down so tight  and they re dying  they re dying  and he supports all these people  all he talks about is shutdowns no  we re not going to shut down  and we have to open our schools  and it s like  as an example  i have a young son  he also tested positive  by the time i spoke to the doctor  the second time  he was fine  it just went away  young people  i guess it s their immune system   i want to open the schools  the transmittal rate to the teachers is very small  but i want to open the schools  we have to open our country  we re not going to have a country  you can t do this  we can t keep this country closed  it is a massive country with a massive economy  people are losing their jobs  they re committing suicide  there s depression  alcohol  drugs at a level that nobody s ever seen before  there s abuse  tremendous abuse  we have to open our country  you know i ve said it often   the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself  and that s what s happening  and he wants to close down  he ll close down the country if one person in our  in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down   i will say this  if you go and look at what s happened to new york  ut s a ghost town  it s a ghost town  and when you talk about plexiglas   these are restaurants that are dying  these are businesses with no money  putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive  and it s not the answer  i mean  you re going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic  these are businesses that are dying  joe  you can t do that to people  which again  take a look at new york and what s happened to my wonderful city  for so many years  i loved it  it was vibrant  it s dying  everyone s leaving new york   new york has lost more than        people         people in nursing    when you say spike  take a look at what s happening in pennsylvania  where they ve had it closed  take a look at what s happening with your friend in michigan  where her husband s the only one allowed to do anything  it s been like a prison  now it was just ruled unconstitutional  take a look at north carolina  they re having spikes and they ve been closed  and they re getting killed financially  we can t let that happen  joe  you can t let that happen  we have to open up and we understand that disease  we have to protect our seniors  we have to protect our elderly  we have to protect  especially  our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems  and we will protect them  we have the best testing in the world by far  that s why we have so many cases   well this is    i don t know if somebody went to wall street  you re the one that takes all the money from wall street  i don t take it  you have raised a lot of money  tremendous amounts of money  and every time you raise money  deals are made  i could raise so much more money  as president and as somebody that knows most of those people  i could call the heads of wall street  the heads of every company in america  i would blow away every record  but i don t want to do that because it puts me in a bad position  and then you bring up wall street  you shouldn t be bringing up wall street  because you re the one that takes the money from wall street  not me  i could blow away your records like you wouldn t believe  we don t need money  we have plenty of money  in fact  we beat hillary clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get  don t tell me about wall street   well  let me respond to the first part  as joe answered  joe got three and a half million dollars from russia  and it came through putin  because he was very friendly with the former mayor of moscow and it was the mayor of moscow s wife  he got three and a half million dollars  your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday  you re gonna have to explain   why did you get three and a half  i never got any money from russia  i don t get money from russia  now  about your thing last night  i knew all about that  and through john   who is john radcliffe  who is a fantastic dni   he said  the one thing that s common to both of them  they both want you to lose  because there has been nobody tougher to russia  between the sanctions  nobody tougher than me on russia  between the sanctions between all of what i ve done with nato  you know  i ve got the nato countries to put up an extra     billion  going to      billion a year  that s to guard against russia  i sold   while he was selling pillows and sheets   i sold tank busters to ukraine  there has been nobody tougher on russia than donald trump  and i ll tell you  they were so bad  they took over the  the submarine port  you remember that very well during your term  during you and barack obama  they took over a big part of what should have been ukraine  you handed it to them  but you were getting a lot of money from russia  they were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are  but now  with what came out today  it s even worse  all of the emails  the emails are horrible  the emails of the kind of money that you were raking in  you and your family  and joe  you were vice president when some of this was happening  and it should have never happened  and i think you owe an explanation to the american people  why is it  somebody just had a news conference a little while ago  who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family  but what he said was damning  and regardless of me  i think you have to clean it up and talk to the american people  maybe you can do it right now   first of all  i called my accounts   under audit  i m going to release them as soon as we can  i want to do it  and it will show how successful  how great this company is  but much more importantly than that  people were saying       i asked them a week ago  i said  what did i pay  they said  sir  you pre paid tens of millions of dollars  i prepaid my tax  tens  over the last number of years  tens of millions of dollars  i prepaid  because at some point  they think  it s an estimate  they think i may have to pay tax  so  i already prepaid it  nobody told me that   excuse me  and it wasn t written whenever they write this  they keep talking about       which i think is a filing fee  but let me just tell you  i prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes  number one  number two  i don t make money from china  you do  i don t make money from ukraine  you do  i don t make money from russia  you made three and a half million dollars  joe  and your son gave you  they even have a statement that we have to give     to the big man  you re the big man  i think  i don t know  maybe you re not  but you re the big man  i think  you son said that we have to give     to the big man  joe  what s that all about  it s terrible    i get treated worse than the tea party got treated  a lot of people in there  deep down in the irs  they treat me horribly  we made a deal  it was all settled  until i decided to run for president  i get treated very badly by the irs  very unfairly  but we had a deal all done  as soon as we re completed with the deal  i want to release it  but i have paid millions and millions of dollars  and it s worse than paying  i paid in advance  it s called prepaying your taxes  i paid   i was put through a phony witch hunt for three years  it started before i even got elected  they spied on my campaign  no president should ever have to go through what i went through  let me just say this  mueller and    angry democrats  and fbi agents all over the place spent      million  they went through everything i had  including my tax returns  and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong      million  i guarantee you  if i spent   million on you joe  i could find plenty wrong  because the kind of things that you ve done and the kind of monies that your family has taken   i mean  your brother made money in iraq  millions of dollars  your other brother made a fortune  and it s all through you  joe  and they say you get some of it  and you do live very well  you have houses all over the place  you live very well    could i just   one thing   his son didn t have a job for a long time  was sadly no longer in the military service  i won t get into that  and he didn t have a job  as soon as he became vice president  burisma   not the best  not the best reputation in the world   i hear they paid him         a month  listen to this       and they gave him a    million upfront payment  and he had no energy experience  that s      dishonest   i have many bank accounts and they re all listed and they re all over the place  i mean  i was a businessman doing business  the bank account you re referring to   which is  everybody knows about it  it s listed   the bank account was in       that s what it was  it was opened  it was closed in       i believe  and then i decided  because i was going to do  i was thinking about doing a deal in china  like millions of other people  i was thinking about it  and i decided i m not going to do it  didn t like it  i decided not to do it  had an account open and i closed it    excuse me  and then unlike him  where he s vice president  and he does business  i then decided to run for president after that  that was before  so i closed it before i even ran for president  let alone became president  big difference  he is the vice president of the united states  and his son  his brother and his other brother are getting rich  they re like a vacuum cleaner  there s something    excuse me  no  i have to respond to this    his son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from china       after spending    minutes in office and being an air force two  number one  number two  there s a very strong email  talking about your family wanting to make     million a year for introductions   first of all  china is paying  they re paying billions and billions of dollars  i just gave     billion   i just gave     billion to our farmers   it s what   no  the taxpayers  it s called china    china pays for     billion and you know what they did to pay it  joe  they devalued their currency and they also paid up  and you know who got the money  our farmers  our great farmers  because they would target it  you never charge them anything  also  i charged them     on dumped steel  because they were killing our steel industry  we were not going to have a steel  and now we have a steel industry  that is a typical statement  just    seconds  please   just a typical political statement  let s get off this china thing  and then he looks   the family  around the table  everything  just a typical politician when i see that   i m not a typical politician  that s why i got elected    let s get off the subject of china  let s talk around sitting around the table  come on  joe  you can do better   when i met with barack obama  we sat in the white house  right at the beginning had a great conversation  was supposed to be    minutes and it was well over an hour  he said the biggest problem we have is north korea  he indicated we will be in a war with north korea  guess what  it would be a nuclear war  and he does have plenty of nuclear capability  in the meantime  i have a very good relationship with him  different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me  we have a different kind of relationship  we have a very good relationship  and there s no war  and you know  about two months ago  he broke into a certain area  they said   oh there s going to be trouble   i said   no  they re not  because he s not going to do that   and i was right   ook  instead of being in a war where millions of people   seoul  you know  is    miles away  millions and millions     million people in seoul   millions of people would be dead right now  we don t have a war  and i have a good relationship   kristen  they tried to meet with him   they tried to meet with him  he wouldn t do it  he didn t like obama  he didn t like him  he wouldn t do it    they tried  he wouldn t do it  and that s okay  you know what  north korea  we re not in a war  we have a good relationship  you know  people don t understand   having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing   and it didn t happen    excuse me  he left me a mess  kristen  they left me a mess  north korea was a mess   remember the first two or three months  there was a very dangerous period in my first three months  before we sort of worked things out a little bit  they left us a mess  and obama would be   i think  the first to say   it was the single biggest problem  he thought  that our country had   first of all  i ve already done something that nobody thought was possible  through the legislature  i terminated the individual mandate  that is the worst part of obamacare  as we call it  the individual mandate    we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance  i terminate it  it s gone  now it s in court  because obamacare is no good  but then i made a decision   run it as well as you can      to my people  great people     run it as well as you can   i could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy  they ran it  premiums are down  everything s down  here s the problem  no matter how well you run it  it s no good  what we d like to do is terminate it  we have the individual mandate done  i don t know that it s going to work  if we don t win  we will have to run it and we ll have obamacare  but it will be better run  but it no longer is obamacare  because without the individual mandate  it is much different  pre existing conditions will always stay  what i would like to do is a much better health care  much better  we ll always protect people with pre existing    so i d like to terminate obamacare  come up with a brand new beautiful health care  the democrats will do it because there ll be tremendous pressure on them  and we might even have the house at that time  and i think we re going to win the house  okay  you ll see  but i think we re gonna win the house  but come up with a better health care  always protecting people with pre existing conditions    and one thing very important  we have     million people out there that have great private health care  far more than we re talking about with obamacare  joe biden is going to terminate all of those policies  these are people that love the health care  people that have been successful    middle income people    been successful  they have     million plans      million people  families under what he wants to do  which will basically be socialized medicine  he won t even have a choice  they want to terminate     million plans  we have done an incredible job with health care  and we re going to do even better   excuse me  he was there for    years    he didn t do it  he was now there as vice president for eight years  and it s not like it was    years ago  it was three and three quarters  it was just a little while ago  right  less than four years ago  he didn t do anything  he didn t do it  he wants socialized medicine  and it s not that he wants it  his vice president    i mean  she is more liberal than bernie sanders and wants it even more  bernie sanders wants it  the democrats want it  you re going to have socialized medicine  just like you went on with fracking     we re not going to have fracking  we re going to stop fracking  we re going to stop fracking   then he goes to pennsylvania after he gets the nomination    well he got very lucky to get it  and he goes to pennsylvania  and he says   oh  we re gonna have fracking   and you never asked a question  and by the way  so far  i respect very much the way you re handling this  i have to say  but by the way  somebody should ask the question  he goes for a year     no  no  but that s a question      it s the same thing with socialized medicine   kristen  when he says      when he says public health option  he is talking about socialized medicine and health care  when he talks about a public option  he s talking about destroying your medicare  totally destroying    he s destroying your social security  and this whole country will come down  you know  bernie sanders tried it in his state  his governor was a very liberal governor  they wanted to make it work         it was impossible     he tried to get rid of        he tried to hurt social security years ago  years ago  go back and look at the records  he tried to hurt social security you ve got     they say the stock market will rule if i m elected  if he s elected  the stock market will crash       k s are through the roof     k        are through the roof  and he doesn t come from scranton  that s like  what     he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew     and he left  and the people of pennsylvania will tell you that   because nancy pelosi doesn t want to approve it  i do    i do  but i still have to get  unfortunate    that s one of the reasons i think we re going to take over the house  because of her  nancy pelosi doesn t want to approve anything  she d love to have some victories on a date called november    nancy pelosi does not want to approve it  we are ready  willing and able to do something  don t forget  we ve already approved three plans  and it s gone through  including the democrats  in all fairness  this one she doesn t want  it s near the election  because she thinks it helps her politically  i think it hurts her politically    if we made a deal  we d have     the bill that was passed in the house was a bailout of badly run high crime  democrat  all run by democrats  cities and states  it was a way of getting a lot of money  billions and billions of dollars to these cities  it was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people s pockets to people that come into our country illegally  we were going to take care of everything for them  and what that does  and i d love to do that   i d love to help them  but what that does  everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country  we can t do it  this was a way of taking care of them  this was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with covid  as for your question  but it was really a big bailout for badly run democrat cities and states    for small businesses    by raising the minimum wage and helping  i think it should be a state option  alabama is different than new york  new york is different from vermont  every state is different  it should be a state option  so it s very important  we have to help our small business      how are you helping small businesses  when you re forcing wages  what s going to happen and what s been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen  say again   what i d really like  i would consider it to an extent  i really like what i    in a second administration    but not to a level that s going to put all these businesses out of business  it should be a state option  look  i have a read on different places  i know different places  they re all different  some places      is not so bad  in other places  other states          children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people  cartels  and they re brought here and it s easy to use them to get into our country  we now have a stronger border as we ve ever had  we re over     miles of brand new wall  you see the numbers  and we let people in  but they have to come in legally   let me just say  they built cages  you know  they used to say i built the cages  and then they had a picture in the newspaper  there was a picture of these horrible cages and they said   look at these cages  president trump built them   and then it was determined they were built in       that was him   yes  we re working on a very    we re trying very hard  but a lot of these kids come up without the parents  they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs    kristen  they did it  we changed the policy  they did it  we changed it  they set up the cages  they    who built the cages   who built the cages  joe   let me say this  they worked it out  we brought reporters and everything  they are so well taken care of  they re in facilities that were so clean      but just answer one question  who built the cages  a big ask of that  who built the cages    he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do  and i ve changed without having a specific    we get rid of catch and release  got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with  but he had eight years he was vice president  he did nothing except build cages to keep children in    it s so important  it shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws  catch and release is a disaster  a murderer would come in  a rapist would come in  a very bad person would come in    we would take their name  we have to release them into our country  and then you say they come back  less than    of the people come back   we have to send ice out and border patrol out to find them  we would say   come back in two years  three years    we re going to give you a court case  you did perry mason  we re going to give you a court case  when you say they come back  they don t come back  joe  they never come back  only the really     i hate to say this    but those with the lowest iq  they might come back    you don t know the law  joe    they don t come back    but we don t have to worry about it because i terminated it  so we don t have to worry about it  go ahead    yes  i do  and again  he s been in government    years  he never did a thing except in       when he did such harm to the black community  and they were called  and he called them  super predators  and he said that  he said it    super predators  and they can never live that down        your crime bill  the super predators  nobody has done more for the black community than donald trump  and if you look  with the exception of abraham lincoln  possible exception  but the exception of abraham lincoln  nobody has done what i ve done  criminal justice reform  obama and joe didn t do it  i don t even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it  they might have wanted to do it  but if you had to see the arms i had a twist to get that done  it was not a pretty picture  and everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office  they cried in the oval office  two weeks later  they re out saying   gee  we have to defeat him   criminal justice reform  prison reform  opportunity zones with tim scott  a great senator from south carolina  he came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones  it s one of the most successful programs  people don t talk about it  tremendous investment is being made  biggest beneficiary  the black and hispanic communities and then historically black colleges and universities  after three years of coming to the office  i love some of those guys  they were great  they came into the office  and they said   i said   what are you doing after three years   i said   why do you keep coming back    because we have no funding   i said   you don t have to come back every year    we have to come back   because president obama would never give them long term funding  and i did  ten year  long term funding  and i give them more money than they asked for  because i said   i think you need more   and i said   the only bad part about this is i may never see you again   because i got very friendly with them and they like me and i like them  but i saved colleges and universities    but why didn t he do it four years ago  why didn t you do that four years ago  even less than that  why didn t you    you were vice president  you keep talking about all these things you re going to do and you re going to do this  but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing     you know  joe  i ran because of you  i ran because of barack obama  because you did a poor job  if i said you did a good job  i would have never run  i would ve never run  i ran because of you  i m looking at you now  you re a politician  i ran because of you    excuse me    if this stuff is true about russia  ukraine  china  other countries  a wreck   if this is true  then he s a corrupt politician  so don t give me the stuff about how you re this innocent baby  joe  they re calling you a corrupt politician    it s the laptop from hell  the laptop from hell    you mean  the laptop is now another russia  russia  russia hoax  you gotta be    is this where you re going  this is where he s going  the laptop is russia  russia  russia   you have to be kidding here  here we go again with russia    well you have to understand the first time i ever heard of black lives matter they were chanting  pigs in a blanket   talking about police   pigs  pigs   talking about our police   pigs in a blanket  fry  em like bacon   i said   that s a horrible thing   and they were marching down the street  and that was my first glimpse of black lives matter  i thought it was a terrible thing  as far as my relationships with all people  i think i have great relationships with all people  i am the least racist person in this room    i don t  i don t know what to say  i got criminal justice reform done  and prison reform  and opportunity zones  i took care of black colleges and universities  i don t know what to say  they can say anything  i mean  they can say anything  it s a very   it makes me sad because i am the least racist person  i can t even see the audience because it s so dark  but i don t care who s in the audience  i m the least racist person in this room    he made a reference to abraham lincoln  where did that come in  i mean     no  no  i said not since abraham lincoln has anybody done what i ve done for the black community  i didn t say   i m abraham lincoln   i said   not since abraham lincoln has anybody done but what i ve done for the black community   now you have done nothing other than the crime bill  which put    tens of thousands of black men  mostly  in jail  and you know what  they remember it because it you look at what s happening with the voting right now  they remember that you treated them very  very badly  just take a look at what s happening out there   but why didn t he get it done  see  it s all talk no action with these politicians  why didn t he get it   that s what i m gonna do when i become president   you were vice president  along with obama as your president  your leader  for eight years  why didn t you get it done   you had eight years to get it done  now  you re saying you re gonna get it done because you re all talk and no action  joe   you got nothing done  well  you gotta talk   you gotta talk  em into it  joe  sometimes you gotta talk  em into it    like i did with criminal justice reform  i had to talk democrats into it   so we have the trillion trees program  we have so many different programs  i do love the environment  but what i want the cleanest  crystal clear water  the cleanest air  we have the best  lowest number in carbon emissions  which is a big standard that i noticed obama goes with all the time  not joe  i haven t heard him use the term because i m not sure he knows what it represents or means  but i have heard obama use it  and we have the best carbon emission numbers that we ve had in    years  under this administration  we are working so well with industry  but what we can t do   look at china  how filthy it is  look at russia  look at india  it s filthy  the air is filthy  the paris accord  i took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly  when they put us in there  they did us a great disservice  they were going to take away our businesses  i will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs  thousands and thousands of companies because of the paris accord  it was so unfair  china doesn t kick in until       russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away  it would   it would have been   it would have destroyed our businesses  so  you ready  we have done an incredible job environmentally  we have the cleanest air  the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we ve seen in many  many years   and we haven t destroyed our industries   president trump  your response     they came out and said very strongly          will be taken away from families under his plan   that his plan is an economic disaster  if you look at what he wants to do  you know if you look at his plan  you know  you know who developed it  aoc    they know nothing about the climate  i mean  she s got a good line of stuff  but she knows nothing about the climate  and they re all hopping through hoops for aoc    look  they re real play costs      trillion  if we had the best year in the history of our country for     years  we would not even come close to a number like that  when he says buildings  they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows  as far as they re concerned  if you had no window it would be a lovely thing  this is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen  and this wasn t done by smart people  this wasn t done by anybody  frankly  i don t even know how it can be good politically  they want to spend      trillion  that s their real number  he s trying to say it was six  it s      trillion  they want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny  small windows and many other things  and many other things    excuse me  we are energy independent for the first time  we don t need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy  we are energy independent  i know more about wind than you do  it s extremely expensive  kills all the birds  it s very intermittent  it s got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both germany and china  and the fumes coming up   if you re a believer in carbon emission  the fumes coming up to make   make these massive windmills is more than anything that we re talking about with natural gas  which is very clean  one other thing    solar  i love solar  but solar doesn t quite have it yet  it s not powerful enough yet to   to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world     so  it s all a pipe dream  but you know what we ll do  we re gonna have the greatest economy in the world  but if you want to kill the economy  get rid of your oil industry  you want   and what about fracking    you said it on tape    i ll put it on   excuse me  he was against fracking  he said it   i will show that to you tomorrow   i am against fracking   until he got the nomination  went to pennsylvania than he said   you know what  pennsylvania  he ll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it   the families that we re talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money  more money than they ve ever made  if you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for hispanic  or black  or asian  it s nice times greater  the percentage gain than it was under   in three years   than it was under eight years of the two of them  to put it nicely  nine times more  now  somebody lives   i have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you re saying   but they re making a tremendous amount of money  economically  we saved it  and i saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic  we saved it  we got   say what you want of that relationship  we got saudi arabia  mexico and russia to cut back  way back  we saved our oil industry and now it s very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline  remember that   would you close down the   would you close down the oil industry   oh  transition   that s a big statement   we actually do give it to solar and wind     that s the biggest statement  in terms of business  that s the biggest statement     because basically what he s saying is he s going to destroy the oil industry  will you remember that texas  will you remember that pennsylvania  oklahoma  ohio   is he gonna get china to do it  is he going to get china to do it   but that ll cost you    trillion    we have to make our country totally successful  as it was prior to the plague coming in from china  now we re rebuilding it and we re doing record numbers        million jobs in a short period of time etc   but  i will tell you  go back before the plague came in  just before  i was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me  they wanted to get together  we had the best black unemployment numbers in the history of our country  hispanic  women  asian  people with diplomas  with no diplomas mit graduates  number one in the class   everybody had the best numbers  and you know what  the other side wanted to get together  they wanted to unify  success is going to bring us together  we are on the road to success  but i m cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody s taxes  and he wants to put new regulations on everything  he will kill it  if he gets in  you will have a depression  the likes of which you ve never seen  your    k s will go to hell and it ll be a very  very sad day for this country
